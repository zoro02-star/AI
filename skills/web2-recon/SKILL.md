name: web2-recon
description: Web2 recon pipeline — subdomain enumeration (subfinder, Chaos API, assetfinder), live host discovery (dnsx, httpx), URL crawling (katana, waybackurls, gau), directory fuzzing (ffuf), JS analysis (LinkFinder, SecretFinder), continuous monitoring (new subdomain alerts, JS change detection, GitHub commit watch). Use when starting recon on any web2 target or when asked about asset discovery, subdomain enum, or attack surface mapping.
---

# WEB2 RECON PIPELINE

Full asset discovery from nothing to a prioritized URL list ready for hunting.

---

## SETUP (already done — verify only)

```bash
# 1. API keys: subfinder/chaos/notify are ALREADY configured on this box
#    (~/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml, ~/.config/chaos/config.yaml). No env vars needed.

# 2. Update nuclei templates (run weekly)
nuclei -update-templates

# 3. Environment facts (verified): ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/ENVIRONMENT.md
#    - bare `httpx` is Python's client → use ~/go/bin/httpx for probing
#    - proxy is Caido ("procsy"): http://127.0.0.1:8081 (UI/history at 127.0.0.1:8080, no Burp/mitmproxy)
#    - wordlists live in ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/wordlists (NO SecLists)

# 4. Verify core tools
which subfinder dnsx nuclei katana gau dalfox ffuf anew gf interactsh-client; ls ~/go/bin/httpx
```

---

## THE 5-MINUTE RULE

> If a target shows nothing interesting after 5 minutes of recon, move on. Don't burn hours on dead surface.

**5-minute kill signals:**
- All subdomains return 403 or static marketing pages
- No API endpoints visible in URLs
- No JavaScript bundles with interesting endpoint paths
- nuclei returns 0 medium/high findings
- No forms, no authentication, no user data

---

## STANDARD RECON PIPELINE

> This is the fast-lane version for one-shot sessions. For the full phased pipeline
> (scope gate, ports, takeover, content discovery, handoff to lead board) use the
> `reconnaissance` skill or the resumable engine: `recon quick target.com`.

### Pre-Hunt: Always Run First

```bash
TARGET="target.com"

# Step 0: Passive — crt.sh certificate transparency (no API key needed)
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.${TARGET}&output=json" \
  | jq -r '.[].name_value' \
  | sed 's/\*\.//g' \
  | sort -u > /tmp/subs.txt
echo "[+] crt.sh: $(wc -l < /tmp/subs.txt) subdomains"

# Step 1: Chaos (ProjectDiscovery dataset — key already configured in ~/.config/chaos)
chaos -d $TARGET -silent | anew /tmp/subs.txt

echo "[+] Total after chaos: $(wc -l < /tmp/subs.txt)"

# Step 2: subfinder (passive multi-source)
subfinder -d $TARGET -silent | anew /tmp/subs.txt
assetfinder --subs-only $TARGET | anew /tmp/subs.txt

echo "[+] Total subdomains after all sources: $(wc -l < /tmp/subs.txt)"

# Step 3: DNS resolution + live host check (~/go/bin/httpx — bare httpx is Python's client!)
cat /tmp/subs.txt | dnsx -silent | ~/go/bin/httpx -silent -status-code -title -tech-detect | tee /tmp/live.txt

echo "[+] Live hosts: $(wc -l < /tmp/live.txt)"

# Step 4: URL crawl
cat /tmp/live.txt | awk '{print $1}' | katana -d 3 -jc -kf all -silent | anew /tmp/urls.txt

# Step 5: Historical URLs
gau $TARGET --subs | anew /tmp/urls.txt

echo "[+] Total URLs: $(wc -l < /tmp/urls.txt)"

# Step 6: Nuclei scan
nuclei -l /tmp/live.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/ -severity critical,high,medium -o /tmp/nuclei.txt
```

### Output to Organized Directory

```bash
TARGET="target.com"
RECON_DIR="recon/$TARGET"
mkdir -p $RECON_DIR

# All outputs go here:
/tmp/subs.txt         → $RECON_DIR/subdomains.txt
/tmp/live.txt         → $RECON_DIR/live-hosts.txt
/tmp/urls.txt         → $RECON_DIR/urls.txt
/tmp/nuclei.txt       → $RECON_DIR/nuclei.txt
```

---

## ATTACK SURFACE TRIAGE

### Find Interesting Targets in URL List

```bash
# Parameters worth testing
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "[?&](id|user|file|path|url|redirect|next|src|token|key|api_key)=" | tee /tmp/interesting-params.txt

# API endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/api/|/v1/|/v2/|/v3/|/graphql|/rest/|/gql" | tee /tmp/api-endpoints.txt

# File upload endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "upload|file|attachment|document|image|avatar|photo|media" | tee /tmp/uploads.txt

# Admin/internal paths
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/admin|/internal|/debug|/test|/staging|/dev|/management|/console" | tee /tmp/admin-paths.txt

# Authentication endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/oauth|/login|/auth|/sso|/saml|/oidc|/callback|/token" | tee /tmp/auth-paths.txt
```

### gf Patterns (Quick Classification)

```bash
# Install gf patterns: https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf xss | tee /tmp/xss-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf ssrf | tee /tmp/ssrf-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf idor | tee /tmp/idor-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf sqli | tee /tmp/sqli-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf redirect | tee /tmp/redirect-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf lfi | tee /tmp/lfi-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf rce | tee /tmp/rce-candidates.txt

# User-controlled CSS surface (themes, profile pages, HTML email renderers,
# rich-text editors, PDF generators). gf has no pattern for this — grep manually:
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -iE "theme|profile|signature|customize|email|invoice|pdf|render|markdown" \
  | tee /tmp/css-injection-candidates.txt
# → if any hit, run web2-vuln-classes **CSS Injection**
```

---

## JS ANALYSIS

### SecretFinder (API keys, tokens in JS bundles)

Works directly — no venv needed (jsbeautifier installed system-wide):

```bash
# Scan a single JS file
python3 ~/tools/SecretFinder/SecretFinder.py -i "https://target.com/static/js/main.js" -o cli

# Scan all JS URLs found in recon
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep "\.js$" | head -50 | while read url; do
  echo "=== $url ==="
  python3 ~/tools/SecretFinder/SecretFinder.py -i "$url" -o cli 2>/dev/null
done
```

### LinkFinder (Endpoints hidden in JS)

```bash
# Single JS file
linkfinder -i "https://target.com/app.js" -o cli

# All pages (crawls JS from HTML)
linkfinder -i "https://target.com" -d -o cli

# Fast bulk alternative: jsluice over the whole JS inventory at once
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep "\.js$" | jsluice urls | anew /tmp/js-endpoints.txt
```

---

## DIRECTORY FUZZING

### ffuf — Standard Fuzzing

```bash
WL=~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/wordlists   # real location; no SecLists installed

# Directory discovery on a live host
ffuf -u "https://target.com/FUZZ" \
     -w "$WL/common.txt" \
     -mc 200,201,204,301,302,307,401,403 \
     -ac \
     -t 40 \
     -o /tmp/ffuf-dirs.json

# Recursive alternative (installed): feroxbuster auto-tunes depth and filters wildcards
feroxbuster -u https://target.com -w "$WL/common.txt" -x php,json,txt,html --smart --auto-tune

# API endpoint discovery
ffuf -u "https://target.com/api/FUZZ" \
     -w "$WL/api-endpoints.txt" \
     -mc 200,201,204,301,302 \
     -ac \
     -t 20

# IDOR fuzzing with authenticated request
# Create req.txt with Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
ffuf -request /tmp/req.txt \
     -request-proto https \
     -w <(seq 1 10000) \
     -fc 404 \
     -ac \
     -t 10
```

## TARGET SCORING — GO / NO-GO

Score before spending time. Skip if score < 4.

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Max bounty >= $5K | +2 |
| Large user base (>100K) or handles money | +2 |
| Program launched < 60 days ago | +2 |
| Complex features: API, OAuth, file upload, GraphQL | +1 |
| Recent code/feature changes (GitHub, changelog) | +1 |
| Private program (less competition) | +1 |
| Tech stack you know | +1 |
| Source code available | +1 |
| Prior disclosed reports to study | +1 |

**< 4:** Skip
**4-5:** Only if nothing better available
**6-8:** Good — spend 1-3 days
**>= 9:** Excellent — spend up to 1 week

### Pre-Dive Hard Kill Signals

1. Max bounty < $500 → not worth your time
2. All recent reports are N/A or duplicate → hunters saturated it
3. Scope is only a static marketing page → no attack surface
4. Company < 5 employees with no revenue → won't pay
5. Explicitly excludes your planned bug class in rules

---

## TECH STACK DETECTION (2 min)

```bash
# Response headers reveal backend
curl -sI https://target.com | grep -iE "server|x-powered-by|x-aspnet|x-runtime|x-generator"

# Common signals:
# Server: nginx + X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4 → PHP backend
# Server: gunicorn OR X-Powered-By: Express → Python/Node.js
# X-Powered-By: ASP.NET → .NET
# Server: Apache Tomcat → Java
# X-Runtime: Ruby → Ruby on Rails

# Framework from JS bundle paths:
# /_next/static/ → Next.js
# /static/js/main.chunk.js → CRA (React)
# /packs/ → Ruby on Rails + Webpacker
# /__nuxt/ → Nuxt.js (Vue)
```

### Stack → Primary Bug Class Map

| Stack | Hunt First | Hunt Second |
|---|---|---|
| Ruby on Rails | Mass assignment | IDOR (`:id` routes) |
| Django | IDOR (ModelViewSet, no object perms) | SSTI (mark_safe) |
| Flask | SSTI (render_template_string) | SSRF (requests lib) |
| Laravel | Mass assignment ($fillable) | IDOR (Eloquent, no ownership) |
| Express (Node.js) | Prototype pollution | Path traversal + debug surface (`/_debug`, `/__debug__`) → web2-vuln-classes "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints" |
| Spring Boot | Actuator endpoints → web2-vuln-classes "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints" for full surface | SSTI (Thymeleaf) |
| ASP.NET | ViewState deserialization (if encrypted, also test padding-oracle path → web2-vuln-classes **Padding Oracle & Crypto Misuse**) | Open redirect (ReturnUrl) |
| Next.js | SSRF via Server Actions + `/_next/data/` / `/_next/static/chunks/` → web2-vuln-classes "Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints" | Open redirect via redirect() |
| GraphQL | Introspection → auth bypass on mutations | IDOR via node(id:) |
| WordPress | Plugin SQLi | REST API auth bypass |
| SPA frameworks (React / Vue / Svelte / Angular) | DOM XSS sinks via state/router → web2-vuln-classes section 3 "postMessage Testing" for cross-frame entry points | Client-side route auth bypass (role check only in JS) |

---

## CONTINUOUS MONITORING SETUP

Set up once per target. Alerts you before other hunters.

### New Subdomain Alerts (daily cron)

> Ready-made alternative: `python3 ~/submon/submon.py` (installed). Or roll the 10-line
> script below — save as `~/monitors/subs-watch.sh` and add the crontab line.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TARGET="target.com"
KNOWN="/tmp/$TARGET-subs-known.txt"

subfinder -d $TARGET -silent > /tmp/$TARGET-subs-fresh.txt
chaos -d $TARGET -silent >> /tmp/$TARGET-subs-fresh.txt   # key pre-configured

# Diff against known
NEW=$(comm -23 <(sort /tmp/$TARGET-subs-fresh.txt) <(sort $KNOWN 2>/dev/null))

if [ -n "$NEW" ]; then
  echo "NEW SUBDOMAINS: $NEW"
  echo "$NEW" >> $KNOWN
fi

# Schedule: crontab -e → 0 8 * * * /bin/bash ~/monitors/subs-watch.sh
```

### GitHub Commit Watch

```bash
#!/bin/bash
REPO="TargetOrg/target-app"
LAST_SHA="/tmp/$REPO-last-sha.txt"

CURRENT=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/commits?per_page=1" | jq -r '.[0].sha')
KNOWN=$(cat $LAST_SHA 2>/dev/null)

if [ "$CURRENT" != "$KNOWN" ]; then
  echo "New commit on $REPO: $CURRENT"
  echo $CURRENT > $LAST_SHA
  # Get changed files
  curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/commits/$CURRENT" \
    | jq -r '.files[].filename' | grep -E "auth|middleware|route|permission|role|admin"
fi

# Schedule: */30 * * * * /bin/bash ~/monitors/github-watch.sh
```

---

## PORT SCANNING (often skipped — don't skip)

```bash
# naabu — fast port scanner from ProjectDiscovery
# Finds non-standard ports: 8080, 8443, 3000, 8888, 9000, etc.
cat /tmp/live.txt | awk '{print $1}' | naabu -port 80,443,8080,8443,3000,4000,5000,8000,8888,9000,9090,9200,6379 -silent | tee /tmp/open-ports.txt

# Why this matters: admin panels, debug services, internal APIs often run on alt ports
# Example wins: :8080/actuator/env (Spring Boot), :9200/_cat/indices (Elasticsearch), :6379 (Redis)
```

## SECRET SCANNING IN JS BUNDLES

```bash
# trufflehog — high-signal secret detection with entropy analysis
# Scans JS files and git repos
pip install trufflehog3 2>/dev/null || true
trufflehog filesystem --only-verified recon/$TARGET/ 2>/dev/null

# SecretFinder — manual JS bundle scan (works directly, jsbeautifier installed)
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep "\.js$" | head -100 | while read url; do
  python3 ~/tools/SecretFinder/SecretFinder.py -i "$url" -o cli 2>/dev/null
done

# Quick grep for common patterns in downloaded JS
wget -q -r -l 1 -A "*.js" -P /tmp/js-files/ "https://$TARGET" 2>/dev/null
grep -rn "api_key\|apiKey\|client_secret\|access_token\|private_key\|AWS_SECRET\|AKIA" /tmp/js-files/ 2>/dev/null
```

## GITHUB DORKING FOR TARGET

```bash
# Search GitHub for hardcoded secrets before hunting the app
TARGET_ORG="TargetOrgName"  # Check their GitHub org

# Useful dorks (search on github.com):
# org:TARGET_ORG password
# org:TARGET_ORG api_key
# org:TARGET_ORG "Authorization: Bearer"
# org:TARGET_ORG .env
# org:TARGET_ORG "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"

# CLI with gh (GitHub CLI):
gh search code "api_key" --owner "$TARGET_ORG" --json path,repository 2>/dev/null | jq '.'
gh search code "password" --owner "$TARGET_ORG" --json path,repository 2>/dev/null | head -20

# GitDorker (if installed):
python3 ~/tools/GitDorker/GitDorker.py -t GITHUB_TOKEN -d ~/tools/GitDorker/Dorks/alldorksv3 -q "$TARGET" -org
```

## SOURCE DISCLOSURE & EXTRACTION

Recovering an app's source code is one of the highest-leverage recon moves: it converts blind black-box hunting into white-box review. A bare directory-listing or exposed file is usually **Low/Info** on its own — it becomes **Medium/High/Critical** the moment the recovered source yields hardcoded secrets, a confirmed injectable sink, or auth logic you can now bypass with certainty.

> Disclosure is not the bug. The bug is what the disclosure *enables*. Always ask: "With this source/config in hand, can I prove a concrete attack RIGHT NOW?" If the dump is empty or contains only public framework code, it's an N/A — kill it.

### Triage scan — fire these against every live host first

```bash
# One-shot probe of the highest-signal disclosure paths across all live hosts.
# Only 200s with non-empty bodies are worth a human look.
for host in $(awk '{print $1}' /tmp/live.txt); do
  for p in /.git/HEAD /.git/config /.svn/wc.db /.svn/entries /.hg/requires \
           /.bzr/branch-format /.DS_Store /.env /web.config /WEB-INF/web.xml \
           /application.properties /config.php.bak /backup.zip /.git/logs/HEAD; do
    code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$host$p")
    [ "$code" = "200" ] && echo "[HIT] $code  $host$p"
  done
done | tee /tmp/disclosure-hits.txt

# nuclei has curated templates for this — run alongside the manual sweep
nuclei -l /tmp/live.txt -tags exposure,config,git,backup -severity info,low,medium,high -o /tmp/exposure.txt
```

### Exposed VCS — dump it, don't just report the 200

A reachable `.git/` (or `.svn/.hg/.bzr`) lets you reconstruct the **entire repo + commit history** — and history is where deleted secrets, old credentials, and removed debug endpoints live. Reporting "`.git/HEAD` returns 200" with no dump is a weak Low; reporting the recovered source + a secret pulled from it is a strong finding.

```bash
# --- Git (most common) ---
# GitTools is installed at ~/tools/GitTools — use it FIRST (git-dumper pipx pkg NOT installed):
~/tools/GitTools/Dumper/gitdumper.sh "https://target.com/.git/" /tmp/dump-gt
~/tools/GitTools/Extractor/extractor.sh /tmp/dump-gt /tmp/dump-gt-src
# Then mine the recovered repo:
cd /tmp/dump-gt-src 2>/dev/null || cd /tmp/dump-gt
git log --all --oneline                 # every commit, including reverted ones
git log -p --all | grep -iE "password|secret|api[_-]?key|token|BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY"
git show $(git rev-list --all)          # walk objects if checkout is partial

# git-dumper (alt, cleaner rebuilds — one-time install: pipx install git-dumper)
# git-dumper "https://target.com/.git/" /tmp/dump-target

# Quick sanity test before dumping: is the pack/objects tree actually served?
curl -s "https://target.com/.git/config"            # remote URL → confirms real repo
curl -s "https://target.com/.git/logs/HEAD"         # ref log → commit SHAs to pull

# --- SVN ---
# SVN 1.7+ stores everything in a single SQLite DB. Pull it, then read pristine blobs.
curl -s "https://target.com/.svn/wc.db" -o /tmp/wc.db
sqlite3 /tmp/wc.db "SELECT local_relpath, checksum FROM NODES;"   # file list + blob hashes
# Pristine objects live at /.svn/pristine/<2-char>/<sha1>.svn-base
# SVN ≤1.6 instead exposes /.svn/entries (plaintext file list) + /.svn/text-base/*.svn-base
# Tooling: svn-extractor / dvcs-ripper rip-svn

# --- Mercurial (.hg) and Bazaar (.bzr) ---
# Confirm presence then dump with dvcs-ripper:
curl -s "https://target.com/.hg/requires"           # hg fingerprint
curl -s "https://target.com/.bzr/branch-format"     # bzr fingerprint
~/tools/dvcs-ripper/rip-hg.pl  -v -u https://target.com/.hg/
~/tools/dvcs-ripper/rip-bzr.pl -v -u https://target.com/.bzr/
```

> If the repo dumps but contains only vendored framework code with no secrets and no app logic, that's an Info disclosure at best. Don't pad your N/A ratio — chain it to a real secret/sink or drop it.

### `.DS_Store` — recursive directory map without brute force

macOS drops a `.DS_Store` in committed folders; deployed to a web root it leaks the exact filenames in each directory. Recurse it to map hidden admin panels, backup files, and source paths that `ffuf` would never guess.

```bash
# ds_store_exp parses each .DS_Store, then fetches and recurses into the names it finds.
pip install ds-store           # provides the parser
python3 ~/tools/ds_store_exp/ds_store_exp.py "https://target.com/.DS_Store"
# It writes the recovered tree to ./<target>/ — grep it for the good stuff:
grep -rilE "backup|admin|config|\.sql|\.zip|\.bak|internal|test" ./target.com/

# Manual parse if you only have one file (no listing/recursion):
curl -s "https://target.com/.DS_Store" -o /tmp/dsstore && strings /tmp/dsstore | sort -u
# Each readable name is a real sibling file/dir → feed back into the triage scan.
```

### Backup / temp / swap file fuzzing

Editors and lazy deploys leave shadow copies that bypass the interpreter and serve raw source. `index.php.bak` or `.index.php.swp` returns plaintext PHP that a normal `index.php` request would execute and hide.

```bash
# Build a candidate list from paths you already know (live URLs + recovered source).
# Mutate each known file with backup/temp extensions, then ffuf against the host.
cat /tmp/urls.txt | unfurl paths | sort -u > /tmp/known-paths.txt

# ffuf: fuzz the EXTENSION on a known basename (e.g. config)
ffuf -u "https://target.com/configFUZZ" \
     -w <(printf '%s\n' .bak .old .orig .save .swp .swo .tmp .txt '~' .1 .copy .inc .dist .sample) \
     -mc 200 -ac -t 20

# ffuf: append archive extensions to the bare hostname + common roots (full-site dumps)
ffuf -u "https://target.com/FUZZ" \
     -w <(for n in backup bkp www web site app source release dist html public_html "$(echo target)"; do
            for e in .zip .tar.gz .tar .rar .7z .tgz .sql .sql.gz; do echo "$n$e"; done; done) \
     -mc 200 -ac -fs 0 -t 20      # -fs 0 drops empty 200s

# Vim swap recovery: .<name>.swp → recover original with vim -r
curl -s "https://target.com/.index.php.swp" -o /tmp/index.php.swp && vim -r /tmp/index.php.swp

# Backup-file extensions fuzz (no local SecLists — extension list is inline):
#   Discovery/Web-Content/BackupFiles.fuzz.txt   (FUZZ-templated, mutates basenames)
#   Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt
ffuf -u "https://target.com/FUZZ" -w ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/wordlists/sensitive-files.txt \
     -mc 200 -ac -fs 0 -t 30
```

### PHP source read — `php://filter` and `.phps`

If you have an LFI / file-include sink (a `?page=`, `?file=`, `?template=` parameter — see the LFI candidates from gf), you can read PHP source instead of executing it by base64-wrapping it through `php://filter`. Recovered source then feeds straight into vuln hunting (find the real RCE/SQLi sink).

```bash
# Base64-encode the target file so the interpreter returns source, not executed output.
curl -s "https://target.com/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php" \
  | grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{40,}' | base64 -d        # → raw index.php source

# Read config files holding DB creds / API keys (this is what escalates severity):
curl -s "https://target.com/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php" \
  | grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{40,}' | base64 -d

# If allow_url_include is on, php://filter can also chain to RCE — note it, then test
# carefully under program rules (see SSRF / file-include classes in web2-vuln-classes).

# .phps — some servers map .phps to a syntax-highlighted source view. Try it on every
# script you can name (no LFI needed):
curl -s "https://target.com/index.phps" -o /tmp/index.phps   # serves highlighted source
for f in index config admin login db; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} $f.phps\n" "https://target.com/$f.phps"
done
```

### Env / config leaks — credentials in the open

These files map 1:1 to a payout when they contain live secrets. A bare `.env` listing framework defaults is Info; one with a working DB password, cloud key, or signing secret is High/Critical (verify the key works — see SECRET SCANNING IN JS BUNDLES for verification flow).

| File | Stack | What's inside (escalation) |
|---|---|---|
| `/.env` `/.env.local` `/.env.production` | Laravel / Node / Rails | `DB_PASSWORD`, `APP_KEY`, `AWS_*`, `STRIPE_*`, mail creds |
| `/web.config` `/connectionStrings.config` | ASP.NET / IIS | DB connection strings, machineKey (→ ViewState RCE — see padding-oracle class) |
| `/WEB-INF/web.xml` `/WEB-INF/classes/*.properties` | Java / Spring | `jdbc.properties`, datasource creds, internal servlet mappings |
| `/application.properties` `/application.yml` | Spring Boot | DB creds, `management.endpoints` exposure (→ Actuator, see Error Disclosure / Debug Endpoints) |
| `/config.php` `/wp-config.php` `/configuration.php` | PHP / WP / Joomla | DB creds, auth salts, secret keys |
| `/appsettings.json` `/secrets.json` | .NET Core | connection strings, JWT signing keys, client secrets |
| `/.aws/credentials` `/.npmrc` `/.dockercfg` | misc | cloud / registry tokens |

```bash
# Pull each candidate and immediately scan the body for live-looking secrets.
for p in /.env /web.config /WEB-INF/web.xml /application.properties /appsettings.json \
         /config.php /wp-config.php /configuration.php /.git/config; do
  body=$(curl -s "https://target.com$p")
  echo "$body" | grep -iqE "password|secret|api[_-]?key|aws|jdbc|connectionstring|begin .*private key" \
    && echo "[SECRET?] https://target.com$p"
done

# WEB-INF/web.xml is shielded by the servlet container — usually only reachable via a
# path-traversal/LFI sink, NOT a direct request. If you can read it, you almost certainly
# have a traversal bug worth far more than the disclosure itself.
```

### What to do with recovered source — turn the dump into the bug

Recon hands you the source; the payout comes from the review. Run this on any recovered repo/config:

```bash
SRC=/tmp/dump-target

# 1) Secrets in tracked files AND in git history (deleted ≠ gone)
trufflehog filesystem --only-verified "$SRC"
git -C "$SRC" log -p --all 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "password|secret|api[_-]?key|token|AKIA|-----BEGIN"

# 2) Dangerous sinks → confirm an injectable path, then test it live

> Severity ladder for a report: `path returns 200` = Info → `recovered full source` = Low → `+ verified secret OR confirmed exploitable sink (SQLi/RCE/auth bypass)` = High/Critical. Submit at the top of the ladder you can *prove*, never the bottom.

**Pattern seen on HackerOne / Bugcrowd:** exposed `.git` directories dumped to full source, then mined for hardcoded credentials in commit history → account takeover / admin access (e.g. the U.S. DoD `.git` exposure report, hackerone.com/reports/1624157). `.DS_Store` recursion has paid out for revealing backup archives and debug-mode internal panels that direct fuzzing missed. Do not invent dollar figures — frame the impact, prove the chain, and let the program set the bounty.

## 30-MINUTE RECON PROTOCOL

### Minutes 0-5: Read Program Page

```
Note:
- ALL in-scope assets (every domain listed)
- Out-of-scope list (read carefully — common trap)
- Safe harbor statement
- Impact types accepted (some exclude "low")
- Average bounty amount (signals program generosity)
```

### Minutes 5-15: Asset Discovery

Run the standard pipeline above. Focus on live.txt output.

### Minutes 15-25: Surface Map

Run gf patterns and the interesting-params grep above.

### Minutes 25-30: Manual Exploration

Open Burp Suite. Browse the app with proxy on:
1. Register an account
2. Perform main user actions (create/read/update/delete resources)
3. Note all API calls in Burp history
4. Look for endpoints not in your URL list

### After 30 min: Prioritize

```
Priority 1: API endpoints with ID parameters → IDOR candidates
Priority 2: File upload features → XSS/RCE candidates
Priority 3: OAuth/SSO flows → auth bypass candidates
Priority 4: Search/filter with user input → SQLi/SSRF/SSTI candidates
Priority 5: Admin/debug endpoints → auth bypass candidates
```
