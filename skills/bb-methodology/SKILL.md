# Bug Bounty Methodology: Workflow + Mindset

Master orchestrator for hunting sessions. Combines the 5-phase non-linear workflow with the critical thinking framework that separates top 1% hunters from the rest.

---

## PART 1: MINDSET (How to Think)

### Core Principle

Hunting is not "find a bug" -- it is "prove an attack scenario." Think like an attacker with a specific goal, not a scanner looking for patterns.

### Daily Discipline: Define, Select, Execute

Before touching any tool:

1. **Define**: "Today I target [feature/domain] to achieve [CIA impact]"
2. **Select**: Choose 1-2 vuln classes (IDOR, Race Condition, etc.)
3. **Execute**: Focus ONLY on selected techniques. No wandering.

### 5 Ultimate Goals (Pick One Per Session)

1. **Confidentiality** -- steal data the attacker shouldn't see
2. **Integrity** -- modify data the attacker shouldn't change
3. **Availability** -- disrupt service (app-level DoS only)
4. **Account Takeover** -- control another user's account
5. **RCE** -- execute commands on the server

### 4 Thinking Domains

#### 1. Critical Thinking (deep analysis)

**Question trust boundaries:**
- Frontend control disabled? Send request directly via proxy
- `user_role=user` cookie? Change to `admin`
- `price=1000` in POST? Change to `1`
- `<script>` blocked? Try `<img onerror=...>`

**Reverse-engineer developer psychology:**
- Feature A has auth checks -> Similar feature B (newly added) probably doesn't
- Complex flows (coupon + points + refund) -> Edge cases have bugs
- `/api/v2/user` exists -> Does `/api/v1/user` still work with weaker auth?

**What-If experiments:**
- Skip checkout -> hit `/checkout/success` directly
- Skip 2FA -> navigate to `/dashboard`
- Send coupon request 10x simultaneously -> Race condition?
- Replace `guid=f8a2...` with `id=100` on sibling endpoint -> IDOR?

#### 2. Multi-Perspective (multiple angles)

| Perspective | What to check |
|------------|---------------|
| Horizontal (same role) | User A's token + User B's ID -> IDOR |
| Vertical (different role) | Regular user -> `/admin/deleteUser` |
| Data flow (proxy view) | Hidden params in JSON: `debug=false`, `discount_rate` |
| Time/State | Race conditions, post-delete session reuse |
| Client environment | Mobile UA -> legacy API with weaker auth |
| Business impact | "What's the $ damage if this breaks?" |

#### 3. Tactical Thinking (pattern detection)

- **Naming anomaly**: `userId` everywhere but suddenly `user_id` -> different dev, weaker security
- **Error diff**: Same 403 but different JSON structure -> different backend systems
- **200 but wrong body length/content**: `200 OK` with tiny response or "just a moment" text → WAF soft block, not a real response. Run `bypass_403.sh` to confirm and get baseline diff.
- **Environment diff**: Prod vs Dev/Staging -> debug headers, CSP disabled
- **Version diff**: JS file before/after update -> new endpoints, removed params
- **Supply chain**: Check framework/library versions for known CVEs
- **Third-party integration**: Stripe/Auth0/Intercom -> webhook signature missing?

#### 4. Strategic Thinking (big picture)

- **Asymmetry**: Defender must patch ALL holes. You only need ONE.
- **Intuition engineering**: Log why something "feels wrong." Verify later. Update mental DB.
- **Unknown management**: Can't understand something? Add to "investigate later" list. Just-in-Time Learning.

#### 5. AI-Assisted Thinking (model as a second analyst)

Use AI to expand hypotheses, not to declare verdicts. The model is a fast adversarial planner; the browser, proxy, and live requests are the proof layer.

- **Decompose the feature**: ask for actors, assets, entry points, state transitions, and trust boundaries.
- **Generate sibling paths**: versioned endpoints, mobile routes, legacy APIs, alternate roles, and admin-only variants.
- **Build a role matrix**: anonymous, user A, user B, stale session, fresh session, admin, service account.
- **Ask for dev shortcuts**: "Where would a tired developer skip a check or reuse a helper?"
- **Ask for chains**: "If this bug is real, what bug B and C sit next to it?"
- **Turn ideas into requests**: every AI suggestion must become a single reproducible HTTP experiment.
- **Kill weak signals fast**: if AI cannot point to a concrete request, response diff, or cross-account delta, the idea stays as a hypothesis.

High-signal prompts:
- "Given this endpoint and feature, list the 10 most likely trust-boundary mistakes."
- "What sibling endpoints, methods, or roles should I test next?"
- "Which bug class would a rushed implementation likely miss here?"
- "What does the smallest proof request look like?"
- "What would make this become a real report instead of a scanner hit?"

### Amateur vs Pro: 7-Phase Comparison

| Phase | Amateur | Pro |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Recon | Main domain only | Shadow IT, dev environments, all assets |
| Discovery | Look for errors | Look for design contradictions, business logic flaws |
| Exploit | Give up when blocked | Build filter-bypass payloads |
| Escalation | Report the phenomenon only | Chain to real harm (session steal, ATO) |
| Feasibility | Include unrealistic conditions | Minimize attack prerequisites |
| Reporting | State facts only | Quantify business risk |
| Retest | Check if old PoC fails | Analyze fix method, find incomplete patches |

### Two Approach Routes

- **Route A (Feature-based)**: "This feature is complex" -> deep-dive its input handling -> find vuln
- **Route B (Vuln-based)**: "I want IDOR" -> find endpoints with sequential IDs -> test access control

### Anti-Patterns (Stop Doing These)

- **Program hopping**: Stick with one target minimum 2 weeks / 30 hours
- **Tool-only hunting**: Automation finds duplicates. Manual testing finds unique bugs.
- **Rabbit hole**: Max 45 min per parameter. Set a timer. If stuck, sleep on it.
- **No goal**: "Just looking around" = wasted time. Always Define first.

## PART 2: WORKFLOW (What to Do)

### The 5-Phase Non-Linear Flow

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
|                                                 |
|  +----------+    +----------+    +----------+   |
|  | 1. RECON |---+| 2. MAP   |---+| 3. FIND  |  |
|  +----------+    +-----+----+    +-----+-----+  |
|       ^                |               |         |
|       |                v               v         |
|       |          +----------+    +----------+    |
|       +----------| 4. PROVE |---+| 5. REPORT|   |
|                  +----------+    +----------+    |
|                                                  |
|  Non-linear: stuck at any phase -> go back       |
|  New API found at phase 3 -> return to phase 2   |
|  WAF blocks at phase 4 -> origin IP from phase 1 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

**THIS IS NOT LINEAR.** Move freely between phases. When stuck, return to a previous phase.

### Phase 0: SESSION START (Every Time)

**Before touching any tool, answer these:**

1. **Define**: "Today I target [feature/domain] to achieve [C/I/A/ATO/RCE]"
2. **Select**: Choose 1-2 vuln classes (IDOR, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
3. **Execute**: Focus ONLY on selected techniques
4. **Identity**: Anonymous or authenticated? If the bugs you're hunting need a
   session (IDOR, BOLA, privilege escalation, auth bypass, mass-assignment),
   load auth **once** at session start — see `docs/auth-sessions.md`. Then
   every downstream tool (httpx, katana, ffuf, nuclei, dalfox, PoC verifiers)
   sends those headers automatically and audit log entries are stamped with
   a stable `session_id` hash.

**Route selection -- Wide or Deep?**

| Signal | Wide (recon sweep) | Deep (focused testing) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| New program, first day | X | |
| Wildcard scope `*.target.com` | X | |
| Main webapp, been here >3 days | | X |
| Scope update (new domain added) | X | |
| Found interesting subdomain | | X |
| Hunting IDOR / BOLA / auth bugs | | X (auth-aware) |

### Phase 1: RECON

**Goal**: Maximize attack surface. Find what others missed.

**Wide approach** (initial sweep):
```
Subdomain enum -> DNS resolution -> HTTP probing -> Port scan -> Tech detect
```

**Deep approach** (targeted):
```
Google Dorks -> JS file download -> Hidden param discovery -> API mapping
```

| What you find | Next action |
|--------------|-------------|
| Live subdomains with tech stack | Phase 2 (Mapping) |
| Known software (WordPress, Jira) | Check CVEs + defaults immediately |
| Cloud resources (S3, Firebase) | Test permissions (read/write/list) |
| 403 **or 200 + block page** on endpoint | `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/bypass_403.sh <url>` auto-detects soft blocks (200+block-body). Verdict: bypassed/needs_review/blocked. If all blocked after 5 min, skip |
| Nothing after 5 min on a host | Skip, try next host (5-minute rule) |

**Command**: `/recon target.com`

**After every recon (mandatory):**
```bash
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/lead_board.py ingest target.com
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/lead_board.py show target.com
python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/lead_board.py next target.com
# Route in plain language: "GraphQL endpoint → skills/graphql-audit"
# touch status when you start / kill / report a lead
```
(`hunt.py` runs ingest + EOL automatically unless `--skip-leads`.)

### Phase 2: MAPPING & ANALYSIS

**Goal**: Understand the app like its developer does.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Map all endpoints (Caido sitemap at 127.0.0.1:8080 + JS analysis)
- [ ] Identify auth model (cookie, JWT, OAuth, SAML?)
- [ ] Find business-critical flows (payment, registration, password reset, data export)
- [ ] Download and analyze JS files for hidden routes, secrets, logic
- [ ] Identify roles and permissions (user, admin, API keys)
- [ ] Note "weird" behaviors (anomalies in naming, errors, timing)

| What you find | Next action |
|--------------|-------------|
| JS files with interesting code | Taint analysis (Sink -> Source) |
| OAuth/SAML authentication | OAuth/SAML checklist |
| API with ID parameters | Phase 3, target IDOR |
| Complex business logic (payment, coupon) | Phase 3, target BizLogic |
| postMessage listeners | DOM analysis, postMessage-tracker |

### Phase 3: VULNERABILITY DISCOVERY

**Goal**: Find the bug. Use Error-based first, then Blind-based.

**Decision flow based on what you're testing:**

```
What input are you testing?
+-- ID parameter (user_id, order_id)
|   -> IDOR checklist
+-- Search/filter/sort field
|   -> SQLi, NoSQLi probing
+-- URL input / webhook / PDF gen
|   -> SSRF checklist
+-- Text field reflected in page
|   -> XSS (DOM or reflected)
+-- File upload
|   -> SVG XSS, web shell, path traversal
+-- Price/quantity/coupon
|   -> Business logic, race conditions
+-- Login / 2FA / password reset
|   -> Auth bypass
+-- Profile update API
|   -> Mass Assignment
+-- Template / wiki editor
|   -> SSTI
+-- Nothing obvious
    -> Fuzz with ffuf, try Error-based probing
```

**Error vs Blind decision:**
1. Try Error-based first (send `'`, `"`, `{{7*7}}`, `${7*7}`) -- watch for 500 errors, stack traces
2. No error? Time-based (`SLEEP(10)`, `; sleep 10;`) -- watch response time
3. No time diff? OOB (`curl attacker.com`, interactsh) -- watch for DNS callback
4. Still nothing? Boolean (`AND 1=1` vs `AND 1=0`) -- watch content-length diff

| What you find | Next action |
|--------------|-------------|
| Low-impact behavior (redirect, self-XSS, cookie injection) | Chain it -- find a connector gadget |
| Confirmed vuln (XSS, IDOR, SQLi) | Phase 4 (Prove and Escalate) |
| Blocked by WAF/CSP/403 **or soft-block 200** | `/bypass-403 <url>` → check verdict (not just status) → `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/waf_encoder.py "<payload>"` → if upload: `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/multipart_mutator.py` → 5 min, kill |
| Known software vuln (CVE) | 1-day speed workflow |
| Nothing after 20 min on this endpoint | Rotate (20-minute rule) |

### Phase 4: PROVE & ESCALATE

**Goal**: Prove maximum business impact. Turn Low into Critical.

**Escalation decision:**
```
What did you find?
+-- XSS
|   +-- Can steal cookie/token? -> Session hijack -> ATO
|   +-- Cookie is HttpOnly? -> Force email change via XHR -> ATO
|   +-- Self-XSS only? -> Find CSRF to trigger it
+-- IDOR
|   +-- Can read PII? -> Automate scraping, show scale
|   +-- Can change password/email? -> Direct ATO
|   +-- UUID only? -> Find UUID leak source, then retry
+-- SSRF
|   +-- DNS only? -> DON'T REPORT. Try cloud metadata
|   +-- Can reach 169.254.169.254? -> Extract keys -> RCE
|   +-- Internal port scan? -> Find Redis/K8s -> RCE
+-- SQLi
|   +-- Error-based? -> Extract data (passwords, tokens)
|   +-- Can INTO OUTFILE? -> Web shell -> RCE
|   +-- Blind? -> Boolean/Time extraction
+-- Open Redirect
|   +-- OAuth flow? -> Token theft -> ATO
|   +-- javascript: scheme? -> XSS
+-- Blocked by defense
|   -> Bypass (WAF/CSP/proxy/sanitizer/2FA)
+-- Low-impact, can't escalate alone
    -> Find connector gadget for chain
```

**After proving impact, check:**
- [ ] Can attack work with 0-1 clicks? (minimize prerequisites)
- [ ] Does it affect all users or specific role?
- [ ] What's the business $ impact?

### Phase 5: VALIDATE & REPORT

**Goal**: Get paid. Make triager's job easy.

**Pre-report gate:**
```
Run /validate (7-Question Gate)
+-- All 7 pass? -> Write report
+-- Any fail? -> KILL the finding. Don't waste time.
+-- Borderline? -> Run /triage for quick go/no-go
```

**Report:**
```
Run /report
+-- Platform-specific format (H1/Bugcrowd/Intigriti/Immunefi)
+-- Title: [Bug Class] in [Endpoint] allows [role] to [impact]
+-- Impact-first summary (sentence 1 = what attacker CAN do)
+-- Exact HTTP requests in Steps to Reproduce
+-- Under 600 words
+-- CVSS 3.1 score that MATCHES actual impact
```

**After submission:**
- [ ] While waiting for triage: try to escalate further (A->B signal method)
- [ ] If fix deployed: re-test for bypass (incomplete patch = new bug)
- [ ] Record finding with `/remember` for hunt memory

## PART 3: NAVIGATION & TIMING

### Non-Linear Navigation Quick Reference

| I'm stuck because... | Go to... |
|----------------------|----------|
| Can't find any subdomains | Phase 1: Try different recon sources, Google Dorks |
| Found subdomain but don't know what to test | Phase 2: Map the app, download JS, understand auth |
| Testing but nothing works | Phase 3: Switch vuln class (20-min rotation rule) |
| Found a bug but impact is low | Phase 4: Escalation paths or gadget chaining |
| WAF/CSP/403 blocking my payload | `/bypass-403` → fingerprint WAF → `waf_encoder.py` variants → kill if 5 min spent (403 even after `/bypass-403` + WAF fingerprint + `waf_encoder.py` variants) |
| Been stuck for 45 min on one param | STOP. Rabbit hole. Move to next endpoint. |
| New API endpoint discovered during testing | Return to Phase 2: map it before attacking |
| Found one bug | A->B signal: same dev made more mistakes. Hunt 20 min for siblings. |

### 20-Minute Rotation Clock

Every 20 minutes ask yourself: **"Am I making progress?"**
- Yes -> Continue
- No -> Rotate to next: endpoint -> subdomain -> vuln class -> target
- Been on same target 2+ weeks with no findings? -> Consider switching program

### Tool Routing by Phase

All `tools/` scripts live at `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/`. Proxy = Caido
`http://127.0.0.1:8081` (UI :8080). Probing httpx = `~/go/bin/httpx`.

> **Caido control (history search, replay, findings, intercept) = `skills/caido/SKILL.md`.**
> Route every important request through the proxy; mine captured traffic via its GraphQL
> helper (`caidoq.sh`) instead of re-sending requests. Pre-flight:
> `pgrep -f caido-cli || nohup caido-cli --proxy-listen 0.0.0.0:8081 --ui-listen 127.0.0.1:8080 > /tmp/caido.log 2>&1 &`

| Phase | Tools | Why this order |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Recon: Subdomains | `subfinder` -> `chaos` -> `puredns` -> `~/go/bin/httpx` | Passive first (no detection) -> resolve DNS -> probe HTTP + tech stack (amass only for deep passive on high-value targets) |
| Recon: URLs | `gau` + `waymore` -> `katana` -> `anew`/`sort -u` | Archive (forgotten endpoints) -> active crawl (JS-rendered) -> dedupe (uro not installed) |
| Recon: JS | `jsluice urls/secrets` + `linkfinder` + `trufflehog --only-verified` | Extract URLs/secrets -> find API keys -> verify keys actually work (mantra not installed) |
| Recon: Ports | `naabu -p -` (full range on interesting targets) | Fast top-1000 sweep -> full 65535 (rustscan not installed; naabu covers it) |
| Recon: Scan | `nuclei -tags cve` -> `nuclei -tags takeover` | Known CVEs first -> then takeover (act immediately) |
| **After recon (ALWAYS)** | `python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/lead_board.py ingest <target>` → `show` → `next` | Route every signal to a `hunt-*` skill; never lose a lead. `touch` when you start/kill/report |
| After recon: EOL | `python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/eol_check.py --tech "php=7.4,nginx=1.18"` | Flag EOL products from `technologies.txt` fingerprints |
| Mapping: Params | `arjun` (+ `-oB http://127.0.0.1:8081`) / `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/param_discovery.sh` | Brute-force hidden params + cache headers (paramspider/ParamMiner unavailable — arjun covers it) |
| Mapping: GraphQL | `bash ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/graphql_audit.sh <url>` | Introspection → fingerprint → batching → IDOR → injection |
| Mapping: CI/CD | `bash ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/cicd_scanner.sh owner/repo` | Workflow injection / secret exfil / runner poisoning (sisakulint absent — script falls back to grep) |
| Mapping: JS code | Download -> `jsluice` -> VS Code/Cursor grep | Extract -> static analysis -> AI-assisted taint analysis |
| Mapping: Dorks | Manual Google Dorks | Custom per-target queries find what automation misses |
| Discovery: Fuzz | `ffuf -ac` + `cewler` custom wordlist | Auto-calibrate filtering + target-specific words beat generic lists |
| Discovery: XSS | `kxss` -> `dalfox` | Filter (which params reflect?) -> scan (only reflective params) |
| Discovery: SQLi | `ghauri` | Modern blind SQLi on ID-like parameters |
| Discovery: SSRF | `interactsh-client` | Self-hosted OOB listener for blind SSRF/XXE/RCE |
| Discovery: WAF | `wafw00f` → `~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/bypass_403.sh` → `waf_encoder.py` → `waf_response_analyzer.py` | Fingerprint → soft-block aware bypass → encoded variants → score response |
| Exploit: 403 | `bypass_403.sh` / `byp4xx` | Soft-block (200+block body) aware; verdict: bypassed/needs_review/blocked |
| Exploit: Upload | `multipart_mutator.py --file shell --field f` | Parser-confusion multipart variants |
| **Exploit: Custom** | When `ffuf`/`nuclei`/`sqlmap`/`dalfox` can't express it (multi-step authz, cross-account IDOR, race window, signature-reversed API, bespoke probe) → `skills/custom-scanner-kit`: scaffold `python3 ~/.config/opencode/skills/custom-scanner-kit/scripts/scanplate.py --name <x> --out .` → add logic from `references/pattern-library.md` | Auto-wired: bb-common scope gate, Caido proxy, rate limit/retry, baseline diff, secret redaction. Tool unless you can name why it fails. |
| Exploit: Takeover | `takeover_scanner.sh` / `subzy` | CNAME against vulnerable services |
| Exploit: Cloud | `cloud_recon.sh` (curl-based checks — no aws CLI) | Scan bucket permissions -> extract metadata credentials |
| Exploit: Secrets | `secrets_hunter.sh` / `trufflehog --only-verified` | Only verified working keys (no false positives) |
| Orchestrate | `python3 ~/tools/claude-bug-bounty/tools/hunt.py --target T` | Recon → lead ingest → EOL → scan (add `--graphql` / `--cve-hunt` as needed) |

### Session End Checklist

- [ ] `lead_board.py show <target>` — any high-priority leads still `new` / stale?
- [ ] Mine Caido history for anomalies the scans missed (HTTPQL via caido skill: 5xx, unusual params, auth headers)
- [ ] Export/pin anything you need — GraphQL API (`caidoq.sh`), not just the UI (http://127.0.0.1:8080)
- [ ] Record any "weird but not yet exploitable" behaviors (future gadgets)
- [ ] Update notes with failed attempts (don't re-test with same techniques)
- [ ] Log findings with `/remember`
- [ ] `touch` every lead you killed or reported
