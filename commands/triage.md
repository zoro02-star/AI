description: Quick 7-Question Gate triage on a finding before writing a report. Kills N/A submissions before they happen. Faster than /validate — for quick go/no-go decisions. Usage: /triage

# /triage

Quick triage to decide: submit or kill?

## When to Use

Use this before spending time writing a full report. If triage passes, run `/validate` for the full 4-gate check, then `/report`.

## Usage

```
/triage
```

Describe the finding in one sentence. Example:
- "I can read other users' orders by changing user_id in /api/orders/{id}"
- "The /api/export endpoint returns 200 with data even with no auth header"
- "I found X-Forwarded-Host is reflected in the password reset email"

## The 7 Questions (Fast Version)

Answer YES or NO to each. First NO = kill it immediately.

```
Q1: Can I demonstrate this with a real HTTP request RIGHT NOW?
    YES: I have the request/response already
    NO: I need to look at more code first → KILL

Q2: Is this impact type accepted by the program?
    YES: Bug class is on their accepted list
    NO: They explicitly exclude this type → KILL

Q3: Is the vulnerable asset owned by and in scope for the program?
    YES: Domain confirmed in-scope, not third-party
    NO: Third-party service or excluded domain → KILL

Q4: Does this work without admin/privileged access?
    YES: Regular user account is enough
    NO: Requires admin → KILL (99% of programs)

Q5: Is this NOT already known/disclosed/documented behavior?
    YES: Not in changelogs, not in disclosed reports
    NO: It's documented as intended → KILL

Q6: Can I prove impact beyond "technically possible"?
    YES: I have actual data in the response / action completed
    NO: I only have a 200 status or error message → DOWNGRADE

Q7: Is this NOT on the never-submit list?
    YES: It's a real bug class
    NO: Missing headers, self-XSS, open redirect alone, etc. → KILL or CHAIN
```

### Auth-related findings need identity proof

If the bug class involves IDOR, BOLA, auth bypass, ATO, or privilege escalation,
you must prove it across identities:
- Session A reading Session B's data
- Fresh session repro
- Anonymous vs authenticated delta

Blank answers fail this check. If you cannot prove cross-account impact, kill it.

### Common N/A classes

Typical scanner hits that still need a real PoC:
- Reflected XSS without a session consequence
- SSRF with DNS only, no HTTP data
- IDOR on your own data
- SQLi error strings without table data
- CORS wildcard without credentialed exfil
- Open redirect alone
- MFA no lockout without OTP bypass
- SAML metadata exposure without signature abuse

## Fast Kill Checklist

Kill immediately if ANY of these are true:
```
[ ] "Admin can do X" = not a bug
[ ] "Could theoretically lead to..." = no PoC = not a bug
[ ] Bug requires 3+ preconditions simultaneously
[ ] Finding is a missing header, missing flag, missing DMARC
[ ] SSRF with DNS callback only, no data returned
[ ] Open redirect with no OAuth chain or ATO path
[ ] Self-XSS (only affects your own account)
[ ] Introspection only (no IDOR, no auth bypass shown)
[ ] Rate limit on login/contact/search (Cloudflare covers it)
```

## Conditional Kill (chain required)

If it's on the never-submit list BUT you can chain it:
```
Open redirect → OAuth code theft → ATO        = report the chain
SSRF DNS → internal service access = data     = report the chain
CORS → credentialed data exfil PoC            = report the chain
Prompt injection → IDOR via chatbot           = report the chain
```

If you can't build the chain today → KILL IT.

## Output

**GO:** "All 7 pass. Run /validate for full check, then /report."

**KILL [reason]:**
- "Q1 fails — no HTTP request yet"
- "Q4 fails — requires admin access"
- "Q7 fails — open redirect alone is not submittable. Chain it with OAuth theft first."

**DOWNGRADE:**
- "Q6 — you have 200 status but not actual other-user data. Reproduce with two accounts and show victim's PII in the response before reporting."
