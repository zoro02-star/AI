# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **OpenRouter provider** (`openrouter`) for standalone `bughunter` / `brain.py` — set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, choose option 7 in `bughunter setup`, or `BRAIN_PROVIDER=openrouter`. OpenAI-compatible gateway with default model `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` and a short curated model list (same pattern as other cloud providers).
- **Explicit Ollama model selection** — `bughunter setup` now lists installed local models and persists the selected provider/model pair; `bughunter setup --provider ollama --model <name>` supports non-interactive configuration. `--model` / `BRAIN_MODEL` provide one-off overrides, and explicit choices no longer silently fall back to or race a different model.
- **Standalone installer updates** — rerunning `install.sh --agent standalone` now refreshes the active managed `bughunter` path instead of allowing an older system installation to shadow a newer user-local link, and verifies the updated symlink target.
- **SDK-free Ollama fallback** — standalone provider setup and chat now use Ollama's local HTTP API when the Python `ollama` package is unavailable; dependency installation failures are reported instead of silently ignored.
- **Expanded uninstaller** — `uninstall.sh` now covers standalone and every supported agent harness, with managed-file checks, confirmation, configuration preservation by default, explicit `--purge-config` support, and compatibility with its previous `--claude` / `--opencode` / `--both` flags.

## v4.3.2 — AI Hunt Playbook (Jun 2026)

### Added
- AI-assisted hunt guidance in `skills/bb-methodology/SKILL.md` and `skills/bug-bounty/SKILL.md`: use the model for feature decomposition, sibling-endpoint diffing, role matrices, and chain planning, while keeping proof requirements anchored to live requests and cross-account deltas.
- AI-assisted planning signals in `tools/mindmap.py` so generated hunt checklists now surface hypothesis expansion and validation-gate reminders alongside the traditional vuln-class checklist.

## v4.3.1 — Bug Fixes + Hardening (Jun 2026)

### Fixed
- **`tools/vuln_scanner.sh` parse failure** — removed the broken duplicate XSS merge block and restored a single dalfox path against `urls/with_params.txt`.
- **macOS bash 3.2 auth crashes** — replaced empty-array auth splats with the bash 3.2-safe form across recon/scanning scripts so anonymous runs no longer abort under `set -u`.
- **`tools/scope_checker.py` CLI gap** — added a real deterministic CLI with asset checks, URL filtering, JSON output, and clean missing-file errors.
- **`tools/hai_probe.py` / `tools/zendesk_idor_test.py` help-path crashes** — both tools now handle missing `requests` gracefully and print useful `--help` output without importing the dependency first.

### Added
- `requirements.txt` for the Python helper tools and test runner.
- `tests/test_scope_checker.py` coverage for the new deterministic scope checker CLI.

### Changed
- `install.sh` now supports Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi Agent, Codex-style installs, shared Agent Skills, and project-local installs.
- `install_tools.sh` attempts to install Python dependencies after the binary tool pass.
- `tools/validate.py` persists `submission-notes.md` and `validation.json` beside each report skeleton.
- `tools/vuln_scanner.sh` now writes `summary.json` so validation can ingest the scanner confidence and tier counts directly.
- `tools/validate.py` now accepts `--scanner-summary` and records the scanner handoff in `validation.json` and the report skeleton.
- `tools/bypass_403.sh` now compares normalized response bodies before marking a bypass confirmed.
- Added regression coverage for the scanner handoff, bypass normalization, and false-positive classes that commonly come back N/A.

## v4.2.3 — Auto-rotation Stop Hook (May 2026)

### Added
- **`.claude/settings.json`** with a `Stop` hook that runs `python3 -m tools.memory_gc --rotate` (quietly, non-blocking via `async: true`) whenever a Claude Code session ends. Long-running hunts that never trigger an inline write-time rotation now still get GC'd at session end. Hook is a no-op if `tools/memory_gc.py` is missing or the working dir isn't the repo root, so it is safe to ship in the project file.

## v4.2.2 — Restore ReconAdapter (May 2026)

### Fixed
- **`tools/recon_adapter.py`** was missing the `ReconAdapter` class that `tests/test_recon_adapter.py` imports — the test file had been silently uncollectable since the rename in 0db9640. Added the class with read accessors for the subdir-nested layout that `recon_engine.sh` writes (`subdomains/all.txt`, `live/urls.txt`, `urls/with_params.txt`, `js/potential_secrets.txt`, etc.), graphql extraction, fallback path resolution, summary counts, and a `normalize()` method that creates the derived files brain.py expects (`priority/`, `api_specs/`, `urls/graphql.txt`, `subdomains/resolved.txt`).

### Tests
- 31 previously-uncollectable tests in `tests/test_recon_adapter.py` now run and pass. Suite total: **215 passing** (was 184).

---

## v4.2.1 — PatternDB Perf Fix (May 2026)

### Fixed
- **`PatternDB.save()` was O(n²)** — every save re-read the entire JSONL file to dedup. At 10k entries this pegged CPU for 5+ minutes per insert pass. Replaced with an in-memory dedup index of `(target, vuln_class, technique)` tuples, populated lazily on first save and updated per write. 10k saves now complete in ~2 seconds instead of 5+ minutes.

### Added
- `tests/test_pattern_db.py::TestPatternPerformance`: 4 new tests covering the perf bound, dedup correctness at 10k entries, lazy-load via reopen, and corrupted-line resilience.

### Resolved
- **TODO-8 (final item)** — `PatternDB.save()` performance test at 10,000 entries.

---

## v4.2.0 — Memory Rotation (Apr 2026)

### Added
- `memory/rotation.py`: size-based JSONL rotator under `fcntl.LOCK_EX`. Default cap 10 MB, keep 3 backups.
- `tools/memory_gc.py` + `/memory-gc` slash command: scan, rotate, or purge backups across the hunt-memory tree.
- `tests/test_rotation.py`: 22 tests covering rotation primitives, auto-rotation in `AuditLog`/`PatternDB`, multi-process concurrent writes (with and without rotation), and disk-full OSError propagation.

### Changed
- `memory/audit_log.py` `AuditLog.log()`: calls `rotate_if_needed` before each append.
- `memory/pattern_db.py` `PatternDB.save()`: calls `rotate_if_needed` before each append.
- `memory/__init__.py`: exports rotation helpers.

### Resolved
- **TODO-7** — memory GC / rotation policy.
- **TODO-8** (partial) — concurrent-write stress test + disk-full OSError propagation test.

---

## v4.1.0 — Patch: Bug Fixes + Assets (Apr 2026)

### Fixed
- **TODO-4 resolved**: `hunt.py` BASE_DIR path resolution — `hunt.py` was relocated to `tools/` so `TOOLS_DIR`/`BASE_DIR`/`RECON_DIR`/`FINDINGS_DIR` now resolve correctly. All 5 open TODOs are now closed.

### Added
- `logo-banner.svg` and `logo-icon.svg` — SVG vector assets for banner and icon variants

---

### Changed — Existing Skill Enhancement
- `SKILL.md` CI/CD Pipeline section: **5 checklist items → 6 categories, 30+ checks, PoC templates, hunting workflow, and GHSA reference table**
  - **Category 1: Code Injection & Expression Safety** — expression injection, envvar/envpath/output clobbering, argument injection, SSRF via workflow, taint source catalog, fix patterns (env var extraction, heredoc delimiters, end-of-options markers)

## v3.1.0 — CVSS 4.0 + TODO Fixes (Mar 2026)

### Changed — CVSS 3.1 → 4.0
- `tools/validate.py`: Full CVSS 4.0 interactive scorer. Replaces 8-metric CVSS 3.1 with 11-metric CVSS 4.0. New metrics: AT (Attack Requirements), VC/VI/VA (Vulnerable System), SC/SI/SA (Subsequent System, incl. Safety). Scope metric removed. UI now has three values (None / Passive / Active). Score verified via FIRST.org calculator link in output.
- `agents/report-writer.md`: Updated CVSS section to 4.0. New metric descriptions, updated common-pattern examples, verification link.

### Fixed — TODOs resolved
- `agents/autopilot.md` already implemented TODO-2 (safe HTTP methods) and TODO-3 (circuit breaker) — marked resolved in TODOS.md
- `tools/hunt.py` BASE_DIR path resolution was already correct (TODO-4 was based on wrong assumption about file location) — marked resolved
- `tools/recon_adapter.py` created (TODO-5): auto-detects nested vs flat recon format, returns unified `ReconData`. `normalize_to_nested()` migrates legacy flat output. CLI: `python3 tools/recon_adapter.py example.com --migrate`
